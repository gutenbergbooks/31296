<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>DEPENDENCIES IN EUROPE.</h3>

<div class="bk1"><p>HELIGOLAND AND THE FRISIANS.&mdash;GIBRALTAR AND THE SPANISH
STOCK.&mdash;MALTA.&mdash;THE IONIAN ISLANDS.&mdash;THE CHANNEL
ISLANDS.</p></div>

<p><i>Heligoland.</i>&mdash;We learn from a passage in the
<i>Germania</i> of Tacitus, that certain tribes agreed
with each other in the worship of a goddess who
was revered as <i>Earth the Mother</i>; that a sacred
grove, in a sacred island, was dedicated to her;
and that, in that grove, there stood a holy wagon,
covered with a pall, and touched by the priest
only. The goddess herself was drawn by heifers;
and as long as she vouchsafed her presence among
men, there was joy, and feasts, and hospitality;
and peace amongst otherwise fierce tribes instead
of war and violence. After a time, however, the
goddess withdrew herself to her secret temple&mdash;satiated
with the converse of mankind; and then<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the wagon, the pall, and the deity herself were
bathed in the holy lake. The administrant slaves
were sucked up by its waters. There was terror
and there was ignorance; the reality being revealed
to those alone who thus suddenly passed
from life to death.</p>

<p>Now we know, by name at least, five of the
tribes who are thus connected by a common
worship&mdash;mysterious and obscure as it is. They
are the Reudigni, the Aviones, the Eudoses, the
Suardones, and the Nuithones.</p>

<p>Two others we know by something more than
name&mdash;the Varini and the Langobardi.</p>

<p>The eighth is our own parent stock&mdash;the <i>Angli</i>.</p>

<p>Such is one of the earliest notices of the old
creed of our German forefathers; and, fragmentary
and indefinite as it is, it is one of the fullest
which has reached us. I subjoin the original
text, premising that, instead of <i>Herthum</i>, certain
MSS. read <i>Nerthum</i>.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis
ac valentissimis nationibus cincti, non per obsequium
sed pr&#339;liis et periclitando tuti sunt. Reudigni
deinde, et Aviones, et <i>Angli</i>, et Varini, et
Eudoses, et Suardones, et Nuithones, fluminibus
aut silvis muniuntur: nec quidquam notabile in
singulis, nisi quod in commune Herthum, id est,
Terram matrem colunt, eamque intervenire rebus
hominum, invehi populis, arbitrantur. Est in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
insula Oceani Castum nemus, dicatumque in eo
vehiculum, veste contectum, attingere uni sacerdoti
concessum. Is adesse penetrali deam intelligit,
vectamque bobus feminis mult&acirc; cum veneratione
prosequitur. L&aelig;ti tunc dies, festa loca,
qu&aelig;cumque adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non
bella ineunt, non arma sumunt, clausum omne
ferrum; pax et quies tunc tant&ugrave;m nota, tunc
tant&ugrave;m amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione
mortalium deam templo reddat; mox
vehiculum et vestes, et, si credere velis, numen
ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant,
quos statim idem lacus haurit. Arcanus hinc
terror, sanctaque ignorantia, quid sit id, quod
tant&ugrave;m perituri vident."&mdash;"De Moribus Germanorum,"
40.</p>

<p>What connects the passage with the ethnology
of Heligoland? Heligoland is, probably, the
<i>island of the Holy Grove</i>. Its present name indicates
this&mdash;<i>the holy land</i>. Its position in the
main sea, or <i>Ocean</i>, does the same. So does its
vicinity to the country of Germans.</p>

<p>At the same time it must not be concealed from
the reader that the Isle of Rugen, off the coast of
Pomerania, has its claims. It is an island&mdash;but
not an island of the <i>Ocean</i>. It is full of religious
remains&mdash;but those remains are <i>Slavonic</i> rather
than <i>German</i>.</p>

<p>I believe, for my own part, that the seat of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
worship of <i>Earth the Mother</i>, was the island which
we are now considering.</p>

<p>In respect to its inhabitants, it must serve as a
slight text for a long commentary. A population
of about two thousand fishers; characterized, like
the ancient Venetians, by an utter absence of
horses, mules, ponies, asses, carts, wagons, or any
of the ordinary applications of animal power to
the purposes of locomotion, confined to a small
rock, and but little interrupted with foreign elements,
is, if considered in respect to itself alone,
no great subject for either the ethnologist or the
geographer. But what if its relations to the population
of the continent be remarkable? What if
the source of its population be other than that
which, from the occupants of the nearest portion
of the continent, we are prepared to expect? In
this case, the narrow area of an isolated rock assumes
an importance which its magnitude would
never have created.</p>

<p>The nearest part of the opposite continent is
German&mdash;Cuxhaven, Bremen, and Hamburg,
being all German towns. And what the towns
are the country is also&mdash;or nearly so. It is
German&mdash;which Heligoland is <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>The Heligolanders are no Germans, but <i>Frisians</i>.
I have lying before me the Heligoland
version of <i>God save the Queen</i>. A Dutchman
would understand this, easier than a Low German,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a Low German easier than an Englishman, and
(I <i>think</i>) an Englishman easier than a German of
Bavaria. The same applies to another sample of
the Heligoland muse&mdash;<i>the contented Heligolander's
wife</i> (<i>Dii tofreden Hjelgel&uuml;nnerin</i>), a pretty
little song in Hettema's collection of Frisian
poems; with which, however, the native literature
ends. There is plenty of Frisian verse in general;
but little enough of the particular Frisian of
Heligoland.</p>

<p>A difference like that between the Frisians of
Heligoland and the Germans of Hanover, is
always suggestive of an ethnological alternative;
since it is a general rule, supported both by
induction and common sense, that, except under
certain modifying circumstances, islands derive
their inhabitants from the nearest part of the
nearest continent. When, however, the populations
differ, one of two views has to be taken.
Either some more distant point than the one
which geographical proximity suggests has supplied
the original occupants, or a change has taken
place on the part of one or both of the populations
since the period of the original migration.</p>

<p>Which has been the case here? The latter.
The present Germans of the coast between the
Elbe and Weser are not the Germans who peopled
Heligoland, nor yet the descendants of
them. Allied to them they are; inasmuch as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Germany is a wide country, and German a
comprehensive term; but they are not the
same. The two peoples, though like, are different.</p>

<p>Of what sort, then, were the men and women
that the present Germans of the Oldenburg and
Hanoverian coast have displaced and superseded?
Let us investigate. Whoever rises from the
perusal of those numerous notices of the ancient
Germans which we find in the classical writers,
to the usual tour of Rhenish Germany, will find
a notable contrast between the natives of that
region as they <i>were</i> and as they <i>are</i>. His mind
may be full of their <i>golden</i> hair, expecting to find
it <i>flaxen</i> at least. Blue and grey eyes, too, he will
expect to preponderate over the black and hazel.
This is what he will have read about, and what
he will <i>not</i> find&mdash;at least along the routine lines
of travel. As little will there be of massive muscularity
in the limbs, and height in the stature.
Has the type changed, or have the old records
been inaccurate? Has the wrong part of Germany
been described? or has the contrast between
the Goth and the Italian engendered an
exaggeration of the differences? It is no part
of the present treatise to enter upon this question.
It is enough to indicate the difference
between the actual German of the greater part
of Germany in respect to the colour of his<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hair, eyes, and skin, and the epithets of the
classical writers.</p>

<p>But all is not bare from Dan to Beersheba.
The German of the old Germanic type is to be
found if sought for. His locality, however, is
away from the more frequented parts of his country.
Still it is the part which Tacitus knew best,
and which he more especially described. This is
the parts on the Lower rather than the Upper
Rhine; and it is the parts about the Ems and
Weser rather than those of the Rhine at all&mdash;sacred
as is this latter stream to the patriotism of
the Prussian and Suabian. It is Lower rather than
Upper Germany, Holland rather than Germany
at all, and Friesland rather than any of the other
Dutch provinces. It is Westphalia, and Oldenburg,
as much, perhaps, as Friesland. The
tract thus identified extends far into the Cimbric
Peninsula,&mdash;so that the Jutlander, though a Dane
in tongue, is a Low German in appearance.</p>

<p>The preceding observations are by no means
the present writer's, who has no wish to be
responsible for the apparent paradox that the
<i>Germans in Germany are not Germanic</i>. It is
little more than a repetition of one of Prichard's,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
in which he is supported by both Niebuhr and
the Chevalier Bunsen. The former expressly<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
states that the yellow or red hair, blue eyes,
and light complexion has now become uncommon,
whilst the latter has "often looked in vain for the
auburn or golden locks and the light cerulean
eyes of the old Germans, and never verified the
picture given by the ancients of his countrymen,
till he visited Scandinavia; there he found himself
surrounded by the Germans of Tacitus."</p>

<p>For <i>Scandinavia</i>, I would simply substitute the
<i>fen districts of Friesland, Oldenburg, Hanover,
and Holstein</i>&mdash;all of them the old area of the
Frisian.</p>

<p>Such is the physiognomy. What are the other
peculiarities of the Frisian? His language, his
distribution, his history.</p>

<p>The Frisian of Friesland, is not the Dutch of
Holland; nor yet a mere provincial dialect of it.
Instead of the infinitive moods and plural numbers
ending in -<i>n</i> as in Holland, the former end in -<i>a</i>,
the latter in -<i>ar</i>. And so they did when the
language was first reduced to writing,&mdash;which it
has been for nearly a thousand years. So they
did when the laws of the Old Frisian republic
were composed, and when the so-called <i>Old</i>
Frisian was the language of the country. So
they did in the sixteenth century, when the popular
poet, Gysbert Japicx, wrote in the <i>Middle</i>
Frisian; and so they do now&mdash;when, under the
auspices of Postumus and Hettema, we have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Frisian translations of Shakespeare's "As You
Like it," "Julius C&aelig;sar," and "Cymbeline."</p>

<p>Now the oldest Frisian is older than the oldest
Dutch; in other words, of the two languages it
was the former which was first reduced to writing.
Yet the doctrine that it is the mother-tongue of
the Dutch, is as inaccurate as the opposite notion
of its being a mere provincial dialect. I state
this, because I doubt whether the Dutch forms in
-<i>n</i>, could well be evolved out of the Frisian in
-<i>r</i>, or -<i>a</i>. The -<i>n</i> belongs to the older form,&mdash;which
at one time was common to both languages,
but which in the Frisian became omitted as early
as the tenth century; whereas, in the Dutch, it
remains up to the present day.</p>

<p>If the Frisian differ from the Dutch, it differs
still more from the proper Low German dialects
of Westphalia, Oldenburg, and Holstein; all of
which have the differential characteristics of the
Dutch in a greater degree than the Dutch
itself.</p>

<p>The closest likeness to the Frisian has ceased
to exist as a language. It has disappeared on
the Continent. It has changed in the island which
adopted it. That island is Great Britain.</p>

<p>No existing nation, as tested by its language,
is so near the Angle of England as the Frisian of
Friesland. This, to the Englishman, is the great
element of its interest.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the Frisian Germans must begin
with their present distribution. They constitute
the present agricultural population of the province
of Friesland; so that if Dutch be the language
of the towns, it is Frisian which we find in
the villages and lone farm-houses. And this is the
case with that remarkable series of islands which
runs like a row of breakwaters from the Helder to
the Weser, and serves as a front to the continent
behind them. Such are Ameland, Terschelling,
Wangeroog, and the others&mdash;each with its dialect
or sub-dialect.</p>

<p>But beyond this, the continuity of the range of
language is broken. Frisian is <i>not</i> the present
dialect of Groningen. Nor yet of Oldenburg
generally&mdash;though in one or two of the fenniest
villages of that duchy a remnant of it still continues
to be spoken; and is known to philologists
and antiquarians as the <i>Saterland</i> dialect.</p>

<p>It was spoken in parts of East Friesland as late
as the middle of the last century&mdash;but only in
parts; the Low German, or Platt-Deutsch, being
the current tongue of the districts around.</p>

<p>It is spoken&mdash;as already stated&mdash;in Heligoland.</p>

<p>And, lastly, it is spoken in an isolated locality
as far north as the Duchy of Sleswick, in the
neighbourhood of Husum and Bredsted.</p>

<p>It was these Frisians of Sleswick who alone,
during the late struggle of Denmark against Germany,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
looked upon the contest with the same indifference
as the frogs viewed the battles of the
oxen. They were not Germans to favour the
aggressors from the South, nor Danes to feel the
patriotism of the Northmen. They were neither
one nor the other&mdash;simply Frisians, members of
an isolated and disconnected brotherhood.</p>

<p>The epithet <i>free</i> originated with the Frisians of
Friesland Proper, and it has adhered to them.
With their language they have preserved many of
their old laws and privileges, and from first to
last, have always contrived that the authority
of the sovereigns of the Netherlands should sit
lightly on them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they are a broken and disjointed
population; inasmuch, as the natural inference
from their present distribution is the doctrine
that, at some earlier period, they were spread
over the whole of the sea-coast from Holland
to Jutland, in other words, that they were the
oldest inhabitants of Friesland, Oldenburg, Lower
Hanover, and Holstein. If so, they must have
been the <i>Frisii</i> of Tacitus. No one doubts this.
They must also have been the <i>Chauci</i> of that
writer, the German form of whose names, as we
know from the oldest Anglo-Saxon poems, was
<i>Hocing</i>. This is not so universally admitted;
nevertheless, it is difficult to say who the Chauci
were if they were not Frisians, or why we find<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Frisians to the north of the Elbe, unless the population
was at one time continuous.</p>

<p>When was this continuity disturbed? From the
earliest times the sea-coast of Germany seems to
have been Frisian, and from the earliest times the
tribes of the interior seem to have moved from
the inland country towards the sea. Their faces
were turned towards Britain; or, if not towards
Britain, towards France, or the Baltic. I believe,
then, that as early as 100 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> the displacement
of some of the occupants of the Frisian area
had begun; this being an inference from the
statement of C&aelig;sar, that the Batavians of Holland
were, in his own time, considered to have
been an immigrant population. From these
Batavians have come the present Dutch, and as
the present Dutch differ from the Frisians of
<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1851, so did their respective great ancestors
in <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> 100&mdash;there, or thereabouts. But the encroachment
of the Dutch upon the Frisian was but
slow. The map tells us this. Just as in some parts
of Great Britain we have <i>Shiptons</i> and <i>Charltons</i>,
whereas in others the form is <i>Skipton</i> and <i>Carlton</i>;
just as in Scotland they talk of the <i>kirk</i>, and in
England of the <i>church</i>;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and just as such differences
are explained by the difference of dialect on the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
part of the original occupants, so do we see in
Holland that certain places have the names in a
Dutch, and others in a Frisian form. The Dutch
compounds of <i>man</i> are like the English, and end
in -<i>n</i>. The Frisians never end so. They
drop the consonant, and end in -<i>a</i>; as <i>Hettema</i>,
<i>Halberts-ma</i>, &amp;c. Again&mdash;all three languages&mdash;English,
Dutch, and Frisian&mdash;have numerous
compounds of the word <i>h&aacute;m</i>=<i>home</i>, as <i>Threekingham</i>,
<i>Eastham</i>, <i>Petersham</i>, &amp;c. In English
the form is what we have just seen. In Holland
the termination is -<i>hem</i>, as in <i>Arn-hem</i>, <i>Berg-hem</i>.
In Frisian the vowel is <i>u</i>, and the <i>h</i> is omitted
altogether, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Dokk-um</i>, <i>Borst-um</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, we may take up a map of
the Netherlands. Nine places out of ten in
Friesland end in -<i>um</i>, and none in -<i>hem</i>. In
Groningen the proportion is less; and in Guelderland
and Overijssel, it is less still. Nevertheless,
as far south as the Maas, and in parts of the true
Dutch Netherlands, where no approach to the
Frisian language can now be discovered, a certain
per-centage of Frisian forms for geographical
localities occurs.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of the displacement of the Frisians
was, most probably, effected by the introduction<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the Low Germans of the empire of
Charlemagne, into the present countries of Oldenburg
and Hanover; and I believe that the same
series of conquests, which then broke up the
speakers of the Frisian, annihilated the Germanic
representatives of the Anglo-Saxons of England;
since it is an undeniable fact that of the numerous
dialects of the country called Lower Saxony,
all (with the exception of the Frisian) are forms of
the Platt-Deutsch, and none of them descendants
of the Anglo-Saxon. Hence, as far as the language
represents the descent, whatever we Anglo-Saxons
may be in Great Britain, America, Hindostan,
Australia, New Zealand, or Africa, we
are the least of our kith and kin in Germany.
And we can afford to be so. Otherwise, if we
were a petty people, and given to ethnological sentimentality,
we might talk about the Franks of
Charlemagne, as the Celts talk of us; for, without
doubt, the same Franks either exterminated
or denationalized us in the land of our birth, and
displaced the language of Alfred and &AElig;lfric in the
country upon which it first reflected a literature.</p>

<p>There are no absolute descendants of the ancestors
of the English in their ancestral country of
Germany; the Germans that eliminated them
being but step-brothers at best. But there is
something of the sort. The conquest that destroyed
the Angles, broke up the Frisians. Each<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
shared each other's ruin. This gives the common
bond of misfortune. But there is more than this.
It is quite safe to say that the Saxons and Frisians<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
were closely&mdash;<i>very</i> closely&mdash;connected in respect
to all the great elements of ethnological affinity&mdash;language,
traditions, geographical position, history.
Nor is this confined to mere generalities.
The opinion, first, I believe, indicated by Archbishop
Usher, and recommended to further consideration
by Mr. Kemble, that the Frisians took
an important part in the Anglo-Saxon invasion
of Great Britain is gaining ground. True, indeed,
it is that the current texts from Beda and
the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle make no mention
of them. They speak only of Saxons, Angles,
and Jutes. And true it is, that no provincial
dialect has been discovered in England which
stands in the same contrast to the languages of
the parts about it, as the Frisian does to the
Dutch and Low German. Yet it is also true
that, according to some traditions, Hengist was a
Frisian hero. And it is equally true that, in the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, we find more than one
incidental mention of Frisians in England&mdash;their
presence being noticed as a matter of course, and
without any reference to their introduction. This
is shown in the following extract:&mdash;"That same<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
year, the armies from among the East-Anglians,
and from among the North-Humbrians, harassed
the land of the West-Saxons chiefly, most of all
by their <i>&aelig;scs</i>, which they had built many years
before. Then King Alfred commanded long ships
to be built to oppose the &aelig;scs; they were full-nigh
twice as long as the others; some had sixty
oars, and some had more; they were both swifter
and steadier, and also higher than the others.
They were shapen neither like the Frisian nor
the Danish, but so as it seemed to him that they
would be most efficient. Then some time in the
same year, there came six ships to Wight, and
there did much harm, as well as in Devon, and
elsewhere along the sea-coast. Then the king
commanded nine of the new ships to go thither,
and they obstructed their passage from the port
towards the outer sea. Then went they with
three of their ships out against them; and three
lay in the upper part of the port in the dry; the
men were gone from them ashore. Then took
they two of the three ships at the outer part of
the port, and killed the men, and the other ship
escaped; in that also the men were killed except
five; they got away because the other ships were
aground. They also were aground very disadvantageously,
three lay aground on that side of
the deep on which the Danish ships were aground,
and all the rest upon the other side, so that no<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
one of them could get to the others. But when
the water had ebbed many furlongs from the
ships, the Danish men went from their three ships
to the other three which were left by the tide on
their side, and then they there fought against
them. There was slain Lucumon the king's
reeve, and Wulfheard the Frisian, and &AElig;bbe the
Frisian, and &AElig;thelhere the Frisian, and &AElig;thelferth
the king's <i>geneat</i>, and of all the men, Frisians
and English, seventy-two; and of the Danish men
one hundred and twenty."</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the evidence of Procopius that
"three numerous nations inhabit Britain,&mdash;the
Angles, the Frisians, and the Britons."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Whatever interpretation we may put upon the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
preceding extracts, it is certain that the Frisians
are the nearest German representatives of our
Germanic ancestors; whilst it is not uninteresting
to find that the little island of Heligoland,
is the only part of the British Empire where the
ethnological and political relations coincide.</p>

<p><i>Gibraltar.</i>&mdash;This isolated possession serves as
a text for the ethnology of Spain; and there
is no country wherein the investigation is more
difficult.</p>

<p>It is difficult, if we look at the analysis of the
present population, and attempt to ascertain the
proportion of its different ingredients. There is
Moorish blood, and there is Gothic, Roman,
and Ph&#339;nician; some little Greek, and, older
than any, the primitive and original Iberic. Perhaps,
too, there is a Celtic element,&mdash;at least such
is the inference from the term <i>Celtiberian</i>. Yet
it is doubtful whether it be a true one; and,
even if it be, there still stands over the question
whether the <i>Celtic</i> or the <i>Iberic</i> element be the
older.</p>

<p>When this is settled, the hardest problem of all
remains behind; <i>viz.</i>, the ethnological position of
the Iberians. What they were, in themselves,
we partially know from history; and what their
descendants are we know also from their language.
But we only know them as an isolated
branch of the human species. Their <i>relation</i> to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the neighbouring families is a mystery. Reasons
may be given for connecting them with the Celts
of Gaul; reasons for connecting them with the
Africans of the other side of the Straits; and
reasons for connecting them with tribes and
families so distant in place, and so different in
manners as the Finns of Finland, and the Laps of
Lapland. Nay more,&mdash;affinities have been found
between their language and the Hebrew, Arabic,
and Syriac; between it and the Georgian; between
it and half the tongues of the Old World.
Even in the forms of speech of America, <i>analogies</i>
have been either found or fancied.</p>

<p>Be this, however, as it may, the oldest inhabitants
of the Spanish peninsula were the different
tribes of the Iberians proper, and the
Celtiberians; the first being the most easily
disposed of. They it was, whose country was
partially colonized by Ph&#339;nician colonists; either
directly from Tyre and Sidon, or indirectly from
Carthage. They it was who, at a somewhat later
period, came in contact with the Greeks of Marseilles
and their own town of <i>Emporia</i>. They
it was who could not fail to receive some intermixture
of African blood; whether it were from
Africans crossing over on their own account, or
from the Libyans, G&aelig;tulians, and Mauritanians
of the Carthaginian levies.</p>

<p>And now the great western peninsula becomes<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the battle-ground for Rome and Carthage; the
theatre of the Scipios on the one side, and the
great family of the Barcas on the other. On
Iberian ground does Hannibal swear his deadly
and undying enmity to Rome. At this time,
the numerous primitive tribes of Spain may boast
a civilization equal to that of the most favoured
spots of the earth,&mdash;Greece, and the parts between
the Nile, the Euphrates and the Mediterranean
alone being excepted. As tested by their agricultural
mode of life, their commercial and mining
industry, their susceptibility of discipline as
soldiers, and, above all, by the size and number
of their cities, the Iberian of Spain is on the same
level with the Celt of Gaul, and the Celt of Gaul
on that of the Italian of Italy,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>as far as the
civilization of the latter is his own, and not of
Greek origin</i>. But this is a point of European
rather than Spanish ethnology.</p>

<p>That the obstinate spirit of resistance to organized
armies by means of a <i>guerilla</i> warfare,
the savage patriotism which suggests such expressions
as <i>war even to the knife</i>, and the endurance
behind stone walls, which characterizes the
modern Spaniards, is foreshadowed in the times
of their earliest history, has often been remarked,
and that truly. Numantia is an early Saragossa,
Saragossa a modern Numantia. Viriathus has
had innumerable counterparts. Where the indomitable<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Cantabrian held out against the power of
Rome, the Biscayan of the year 1851 adheres to
his privileges and his language; and what the
Cantabrian was to the Roman, the Asturian was
to the Moor. Both trusted their freedom to
their impracticable mountains and stubborn
spirits&mdash;and kept it accordingly. It is an easy
matter to refer the peculiarities of the Spanish
character to the infusion of Oriental blood; and
with some of them it may be the case. But with
many of them, the reference is a false one. Half
the Spanish character was Iberic and Lusitanian
before either Jew or Saracen had seen the Rock
of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Of the early Spanish religion, we know but
little. A remarkable passage in Strabo speaks
to their literature. They had an <i>alphabet</i>. This
is known from coins and inscriptions. And it
was of foreign origin&mdash;Greek or Ph&#339;nician.
This nothing but the most inconsiderate and uncritical
patriotism can deny. Denied, however,
it has been; and the indigenous and independent
evolution of an alphabet has been claimed; the
particular tribe to which it has more especially
been ascribed being the <i>Turdetani</i>. These&mdash;and
the passage I am about to quote is the passage of
Strabo just alluded to&mdash;are "put forward as the
wisest of the Iberi, and they have the use of
letters; and they have records of ancient history,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and poems, and metrical laws for six thousand
years&mdash;as they say."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Now, whatever may be the doubts implied by
the last three words of this extract, the evidence
is to the effect that the old Iberians were a lettered
nation; the antiquity of their civilization
being another question. To modify our
scepticism on the point, the text has been
tampered with, and it has been proposed to read
<i>poems</i> (<span title="ep&ocirc;n">&#7952;&#960;&#8182;&#957;</span>) instead of years (<span title="et&ocirc;n">&#7952;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span>). The change,
to be sure, is slight enough&mdash;that of a single
letter&mdash;from <i>p</i> (<span title="p">&#960;</span>) to <i>t</i> (<span title="t">&#964;</span>); nevertheless, as it is
more than cautious criticism will allow, the reading
must stand as it is, and the claim of the Turdetanians
must be for a literature nearly as old as the
supposed age of the world in the current century,&mdash;a
long date, and a date which would be improbable,
even if we divided it by twelve, and
rendered <span title="etos">&#7956;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> by <i>month</i> instead of <i>year</i>. It denotes
either some shorter period (perhaps a day)
or nothing at all.</p>

<p>So much for the Iberians; of which the Lusitanians
of Portugal were a branch; and of which
there were several divisions and subdivisions involving
considerable varieties both of manners<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and language. In respect to the latter there is
the special evidence of Strabo that their tongues
and alphabets differed. And so did their mythologies.
The Callaici had the reputation of
being <i>atheists</i>; whilst the Celtiberi worshipped
an anonymous God,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> at the full of the moon,
with feasts and dances.</p>

<p>But who were the Celtiberi? I have already
said that there were difficulties upon this point.
The name makes them a mixed people; half Celt
and half Iberic. If so, the French influence in
the Spanish Peninsula was as great in the time of
Hannibal, as it was wished to be in the time of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>With the exception of Niebuhr, the chief
authorities have considered the Iberi as the aborigines,
and the Celts as emigrants from Gaul.
To this, however, Niebuhr took exceptions. He
considered the warlike character of the Iberians;
and this made him unwilling to think that any
invader from the north had displaced them. And
he considered the geographical <i>distribution</i> of the
Celtiberi. This was not in the fertile plains nor
along the banks of fertilizing rivers, nor yet in
the districts of the golden corn and the precious
wool of Hispania, but in the rougher mountain
tracts, in the quarters whereto an aboriginal inhabitant
would be more likely to retire, than an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
invading conqueror to covet, I admit the difficulty
implied in his objection; but I admit it
only as a <i>presumption</i>&mdash;against which there is a
decided preponderance of material facts.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are the oldest names
of the geographical localities throughout Spain.
These, as shown by the well-known monograph
of Humboldt, are <i>not</i> Celtic, and are <i>Iberic</i>.</p>

<p>In the next place, the Celtic frontier was by no
means so near the geographical boundary of the
Peninsula as it is often supposed to have been.
Instead of the Celtic of Gaul reaching the
Pyrenees, the Iberic of Spain reached the Loire&mdash;so
that the province of Aquitania, although
Gallic in politics, was Iberic in ethnology. This,
again, is shown by Humboldt.</p>

<p>For my own part, instead of discussing the relation
of the Celts of Celtiberia to the other
inhabitants of Spain, I would open a new question,
and investigate the grounds upon which we
believe in an intermixture at all. Whatever
respect we may pay to the statements of the
classical writers, the <i>name</i> itself is not conclusive;
since it would be just as likely to be given from
an approach on the part of an Iberic population
to the Celtic manners, or from the adoption of
any <i>supposed</i> Celtic characteristic, as from absolute
ethnological intermixture. Like modern observers,
the ancient writers were too fond of gratuitously<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
assuming an intermixture of blood for
the explanation of the results of common physical
or social conditions. Hence&mdash;without pressing
my opinion on the reader&mdash;I confine myself to an
expression of doubt as to the existence of Celts
amongst the Celtiberi <i>at all</i>.</p>

<p>But this only simplifies the question as to the
ethnological position of the Iberic variety of the
human species. It does not even suggest an
answer. They were the aborigines of Spain.
They are the ancestors of the present Biscayans.
Their tongue survives in the north-west provinces
of Spain, and in the north-east corner
of France. It <i>has no recognized affinity with
any known tongue; and it has undeniable points
of contrast with all the languages of the countries
around.</i></p>

<p>Yet it is only by means of the Basque language
that the problem can be attempted. The physical
conformation of the still extant Iberians, has
nothing definitely characteristic about it. The
ancient mythology has died away. The tribes
most immediately allied have ceased to be other
than unmixed. So the language alone remains&mdash;and
that has yet to find its interpreter.</p>

<p>An Iberic basis&mdash;Greek, Ph&#339;nician, and Mauritanian
intermixtures&mdash;possibly a Celtic element&mdash;Roman
sufficient to change the language through
four-fifths of the Peninsula&mdash;Gothic blood introduced<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by the followers of Euric&mdash;Arabian
influences, second in importance to those of
Rome only&mdash;such is the analysis of ethnological
elements of the Spanish stock. The proportions,
of course, differ in different parts of the Peninsula,
and, although they are nowhere ascertained, it is
reasonable to suppose that the Arab blood increases
as we go southwards, and the Gothic and
Iberic as we approach the Pyrenees. This makes
Gibraltar the most Moorish part of Europe; and
such I believe it to be.</p>

<p><i>Malta.</i>&mdash;When we have subtracted the English,
Italians, Greeks, and other nations of the
Levant from the population of Malta, there still
remain the primitive islanders, with their peculiar
language.</p>

<p>Now this language is a form of the Arabic;
and, with the exception of some of the dialects
of Syria, it is the only instance of that language
in the mouth of a Christian population. So
thoroughly are the language and the religion of
the Koran co-extensive.</p>

<p>At what period this tongue found its way to
Malta is undetermined. As compared with any
of the present languages of the island it is <i>ancient</i>.
But it is not certain that, though old, it is
the earliest. Carthaginians may have preceded
the Arabs; Greeks the Carthaginians; and,
possibly, Sicanians, or the earliest occupants of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Sicily, the Greeks. I am unable, however, to
carry my reader beyond the simple fact of the
<i>language being Arabic</i>.</p>

<p>The only other Arabic dependency of Great
Britain is Aden.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><i>The Ionian Islands.</i>&mdash;The reader may have remarked
the peculiar character of European ethnology.
It consists chiefly in the <i>analysis</i> of the
component parts of particular populations; and
this it investigates so exclusively as to leave no
room for the description of manners, customs,
physiognomy, and the like&mdash;paramount in importance
as these matters are when we come to the other
quarters of the world. There are two reasons for
this difference. First&mdash;the peculiarities of the
European nations are by no means of the same
extent and character with those of the ruder
families of mankind. A similar civilization, and
a similar religion, have effected a remarkable
amount of uniformity; and, hence, the differences
are those that the historian deals with more appropriately
than the ethnologist. Secondly&mdash;such
external and palpable differences as exist
are generally known and appreciated. The <i>analysis</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of blood, or stock, which, partially, accounts
for them, is less completely understood.</p>

<p>Hence, in treating of the Maltese, there was no
description of the Arabic stock at all. All that
was stated was a reason for believing that the
Maltese belonged to it. Such also, to a great
degree, was the case with the Gibraltar population,
and the Heligolanders. And such will be the case
with the Ionian Islanders. It will not be thought
necessary to enlarge upon the Greeks; it will
only be requisite to ask how far the group in
question is Grecian.</p>

<p>The very oldest population of the Ionian Islands
I believe to have been <i>barbarous</i>&mdash;a term which, in
the present classical localities, is convenient.</p>

<p>In the smaller islands, such as Ithaca and Zacynthus,
the population had become Hellenized at
the time of the composition of the Homeric poems.
In Corcyra, on the other hand, the original
barbarism lasted longer. Such, at least, is the
way in which I interpret the passages in the
Odyssey concerning the Ph&aelig;acians (who were
certainly not Greek), and the later language of
Thucydides respecting the relations of the Corinthian
colonies of Epidamnus, and Corcyra. The
whole context leads to the belief that, originally,
the <span title="apoikoi">&#7940;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span> were Greeks in contact with a population
which was <i>not</i> Greek.</p>

<p>In respect to the stock to which these early<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and ante-Hellenic islanders belonged, the presumption
is in favour of its having been the Illyrian;
a stock known only in its probable remains&mdash;the
Skipitar (Albanians, or Arnaouts) of Albania.</p>

<p>Time, however, made them all equally Hellenic,
a result which was, probably, completed
before the decline of Greek independence; since
which epoch there have been the following elements
of intermixture:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Albanian blood, from the opposite coast.</p>

<p>2. Slavonic, from Dalmatia.</p>

<p>3. Italian, from Italy.</p>

<p>4. Turk&mdash;I have no pretence to the minute
ethnological knowledge which would enable me
even to guess at the proportions.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, however, I believe the Ionian
islanders to be what their language represents
them&mdash;Greek. At the same time they are Greeks
of an exceedingly mixed blood.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Again&mdash;of the foreign elements I imagine the
Italian to be the chief. This, however, is an impression
rather than a matured opinion.</p>

<p>The Slavonic element, too, is likely to be considerable.
The Byzantine historians speak of
numerous and permanent settlements, during the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, both in Thessaly,
and in the Morea; statements which the frequency
of Slavonic names for Greek geographical
localities confirms.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Neither, however, outweighs
the undoubted Hellenic character of the language,
which is still the representative of the great medium
of the fathers of literature and philosophy.</p>

<p><i>The Channel Islands.</i>&mdash;As Guernsey, Jersey,
Alderney, and Sark, are no parts of Great Britain,
and are, nevertheless, European, I make a
brief mention of them; although they are neither
colonies nor dependencies: indeed, in strict history,
Great Britain is a dependency of theirs.</p>

<p>They are <i>Norman</i> rather than <i>French</i>, and the
illustration of this distinction, which will re-appear
when we come to the Canadas&mdash;concludes the
chapter.</p>

<p>The <i>earliest</i> population of France was twofold&mdash;Celtic
for the north, Iberic for the south.</p>

<p>Its <i>second</i> population was Roman.</p>

<p>Its language is Roman&mdash;all that remains of
the old tongues of the tribes which C&aelig;sar conquered
being (1) certain words in the present<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
French, (2) the Breton of Brittany, which is closely
akin to the Welsh Celtic, and (3) the Basque dialects
of Gascony, which is Iberic.</p>

<p>Now whether the old Gallic blood be as fully
displaced by that of the Roman conquerors, as
the old Gallic language has been displaced by the
Latin is uncertain. It is only certain that the old
and indigenous elements of the French nation,
however indeterminate in amount&mdash;were not of a
uniform character, <i>i.e.</i>, neither wholly Celtic, nor
wholly Iberic; but Celtic for one part of the
country, and Iberic for another.</p>

<p>The ancient tribes of Normandy were <i>Celtic</i>.
Hence, when the third element of the present
Norman population was introduced, all that was
not Italian was Welsh&mdash;just as it was in Picardy
and Orleans, and just as it was <i>not</i> in Gascony
and Poitou. <i>There</i> the old element was Iberic.</p>

<p>The <i>third element</i>&mdash;just alluded to&mdash;was Germanic;
Germanic of different kinds, but chiefly
Frank or Burgundian.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> great element was the Norse or
Scandinavian; introduced by the so-called <i>Sea-kings</i>
of Denmark and Norway in the ninth and
tenth centuries. These, as the empire of Charlemagne
declined, insulted and dismembered it.
They converted Neustria in <i>Normandy</i>=<i>the
country of the Northmen</i>. The exact amount
of their influence has not been ascertained; nor is<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the investigation easy. The process, however, by
which we measured the original extent of the
Frisian area is applicable to that of the Northmen.
There are Norse names for French localities.
Of these the most important are the compounds
of -<i>tot</i>, -<i>fleur</i>, and -<i>bec</i>; like Yve-<i>tot</i>, Har-<i>fleur</i>,
and Caude-<i>bec</i>.</p>

<p>Names of places thus ending are almost exclusively
limited to Normandy; occurring, even there,
most numerously within a few miles of either the
sea or the Seine.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a fresh element suggested
by a term of the "Notitia Utriusque Imperii," a
document of the latter end of the fourth century.
This is <i>Litus Saxonicum per Britannias</i>, a
tract extending from the Wash to Portsmouth.
Now the opposite shore of the continent was a
<i>litus Saxonicum</i> also; within which lay Normandy.
I believe that these Saxons were part of
the same branch of Germans which invaded England;
in other words, that portions of France, like
portions of England, were <i>Anglicized</i>; the two
processes differing in respect to their extent and
duration. What was general and permanent on<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the island, was partial and temporary on the continent.
That there were Saxons at Bayeux in
the tenth century is asserted by express evidence.</p>

<p>Taking in the account the preceding invasions,
and remembering that, both from Germany and
Italy, Normandy is one of the most distant of the
French provinces, we arrive at the following
analysis.</p>

<p>The Channel Islanders are what the Normans
are.</p>

<p>The Normans are Romanized Celts; the Roman
element being somewhat less than it is elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Frank and Burgundian elements are also
less.</p>

<p>But a Saxon element is greater.</p>

<p>And a Norse element is pre-eminently Norman.</p>

Reasons which have induced me to go farther than any previous

in the Anglo-Saxon invasion, and to believe that instead of
<i>Saxon</i> being a native German name for any portion of the

the Germans of the sea-coast, and (amongst these) for the

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>DEPENDENCIES IN AFRICA.</h3>

<div class="bk1"><p>THE GAMBIA SETTLEMENTS.&mdash;SIERRA LEONE.&mdash;THE GOLD COAST.&mdash;THE
CAPE.&mdash;THE MAURITIUS.&mdash;THE NEGROES OF AMERICA.</p></div>

<p><i>The Gambia.</i>&mdash;All our settlements on the
Gambia are in the Mandingo country.</p>

<p>Of all the true and unequivocal Negroes, the
Mandingos are the most civilized; the basis of
their civilization being Arab, and their religion
that of the Koran. Hence, they have priests, or
Marabouts, the use of the Arabic alphabet, and a
monotheistic creed.</p>

<p>Of all the Negroes, too, the Mandingos are the
most commercial, not as mere slave-dealers, but
as truly industrial merchants.</p>

<p>Of all the families of the African stock, with
the exception of the Kaffres, the Mandingo is the
most widely spread. It also falls into numerous
divisions and subdivisions. Hence the term has
a twofold power. Sometimes it is a generic
name for a large group; sometimes the designation
of a particular section of that group. The<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mandingos of the Lower Gambia are Mandingos
in the restricted meaning of the word.</p>

<p>For the Mandingo tribes, when we use the term
in a general sense, the most convenient classification
is into the <i>Mahometan</i> and the <i>Pagan</i>.
That this division should exist is natural; since,
with the exception of the Wolofs, the Mandingos
are the most northern of all the western
Negroes, and, consequently, those who are most
in contact with the Mahometan Arabs, and the
equally Mahometan Kabyles of Barbary and the
Great Desert,&mdash;a fact sufficient to account for the
monotheistic creeds of the northern tribes.</p>

<p>As for the Paganism of the others, we must
remember how far southwards and inland the
same great stock extends&mdash;indefinitely towards
the interior, and as far as the back of the Ashanti
country, in the direction of the equator.</p>

<p>This prepares us for finding Mandingos at our
next settlement.</p>

<p><i>Sierra Leone.</i>&mdash;The native populations which
encircle this settlement are two&mdash;the <i>Timmani</i>
towards the north, and <i>Bullom</i> towards the
south.</p>

<p>Both are Negroes of the most typical kind, in
respect to their physical conformation.</p>

<p>Both are Pagans.</p>

<p>Both speak what seem to be mutually unintelligible
languages, but which have an undoubted<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
relationship to each other, and to the numerous
Mandingo dialects as well. It is this which induces
me to place them in the same section with
the more civilized Africans of the Gambia.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that they are amongst the
rudest members of the stock; indeed it is only in
the eyes of the etymologist that they are Mandingo
at all. Practically, they, and several
tribes like them, are Mandingo, in the way that
a wolf is a dog, or a goat a sheep.</p>

<p>The Bullom and Timmani are the frontagers to
Sierra Leone; and it was with Bullom and Timmani
potentates that the land of the settlement
was bargained for. The settlers themselves are
of different origin. Mixed beyond all other populations
of Africa, the occupants of Free Town
are in the same category with the Negroes of
Jamaica and St. Domingo; concerning whom we
can only predicate that they have dark skins, and
that they come from Africa. The analysis of
their several origins, and their distribution amongst
the separate branches of the African family, would
be one of the most difficult feats in minute ethnology;
and this would be but a fraction of the
investigation. When the several countries which
supplied the several victims of the slave-trade had
been ascertained, the complicated question of
<i>intermixture</i> would stand over; and there we
should find lineages of every degree of hybridism&mdash;children,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
whose ancestors originated on different
sides of Africa, themselves the parents of a lighter-coloured
offspring, the effect of European intercourse.</p>

<p>At present it is sufficient to state that the
nucleus of the Free Town population consists of
what is called the <i>Maroon</i> Negroes. These were
slaves of Jamaica, who, having recovered their
freedom during the Spanish dominion in the
island, were removed, by the English, in the first
instance to Nova Scotia, and afterwards to their
present locality.</p>

<p>Round this has collected an equally miscellaneous
population of rescued slaves; and, besides
these, there are immigrants, labourers, and barterers
from all the neighbouring parts of the
Continent&mdash;Krumen more especially.</p>

<p>A writer who, when we come to the Negroes of
the Gold Coast, will be freely quoted, calls the
Krumen the <i>Scotchmen</i> of Africa, since, with
unusual industry, enterprise, and perseverance, they
leave, without reluctance, their own country to
push their fortunes wherever they can find a wider
field. They are ready for any employment
which may enable them to increase their means,
and ensure a return to their own country in a
state of improved prosperity. There the Kruman's
ambition is to purchase one or two head of
cattle, and one or two head of wives, to enjoy the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
luxuries of rum and tobacco, and pass the remainder
of his days as</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">"A gentleman of Africa who sits at home at ease."<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">Half the Africans that we see in Liverpool are
Krumen, who have left their own country when
young, and taken employment on board a ship,
where they exhibit a natural aptitude for the sea.
Without being nice as to the destination of the
vessel in which they engage, they return home as
soon as they can; and rarely or never contract
matrimony before their return. In Cape Coast
Town, as well as in Sierra Leone, they form a
bachelor community&mdash;quiet and orderly; and in
that respect stand in strong contrast to the other
tribes around them. Besides which, with all their
blackness, and all their typical Negro character,
they are distinguishable from most other western
Africans; having the advantage of them in make,
features, and industry.</p>

<p>A Kruman is pre-eminently the <i>free labourer</i> of
Africa. In the slave trade he has engaged less
than any of his neighbours, attaches himself
readily to the whites, and, in his native country,
as well as in Sierra Leone, Coast Town, and
other places of his temporary denizenship, is
quick of perception and amenable to instruction.
His language is the <i>Grebo</i> tongue, and it has been
reduced to writing by the American missionaries<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of Cape Palmas. It has decided affinities with
those of the Mandingo tongues to the north,
the Fanti dialects of the Gold Coast, and, in all
probability, still closer ones with those of the
Ivory coast. These last, however, are but imperfectly
known; indeed, a single vocabulary of
the <i>Avekvom</i> language, in the "American Oriental
Journal," furnishes nine-tenths of our philological
data for the parts between Cape Palmas
and Cape Apollonia.</p>

<p>The best measure of the heterogeneousness of
the Sierra Leone population is to be found in
Mrs. Kilham's vocabularies. That lady collected,
at Free Town, specimens of thirty-one African
tongues, from Negroes then and there resident.
Of these&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Eight belonged to the Mandingo group,
<i>viz.</i>, Mandingo Proper, Susu, Bambara, Kossa,
Pessa, Kissi, Bullom, and Timmani.</p>

<p>B. Two were dialects of the Grebo (Kru): the
Kru, and the Bassa.</p>

<p>C. Two were Fanti: the Fanti and the
Ashanti, closely allied dialects.</p>

<p>D. Two were Dahoman: the Fot, and the
Popo.</p>

<p>E. Two Benin: the Benin Proper, and the
Moko, languages of a tract but little known.</p>

<p>F. One Wolof, from the Senegal.</p>

<p>G. Eight from the parts between the rivers<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Formosa and Loango, <i>viz.</i>, the Bongo, the Ako,
the Ibu, the Rungo, the Akuonga, the Karaba,
the Uobo, the Kouri.</p>

<p>H. One from the river Kongo, <i>i.e.</i>, the Kongo
properly so-called.</p>

<p>I. Two from the Lower Niger, but, still separated
from the coast&mdash;the Tapua (Nufi) and
Appa.</p>

<p>K. Three from the widely-spread nations of
the interior&mdash;the Fulah, the Haussa, and the
Bornu.</p>

<p>I do not say that all Mrs. Kilham's specimens
represent mutually unintelligible tongues; probably
they do not. At the same time, as several
decidedly different languages are omitted, the list
understates, rather than exaggerates, the number
of the divisions and subdivisions of the western
African populations, as inferred from the divisions
and subdivisions of the language.</p>

<p>Thus, no samples are given of the&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Sereres.</i>&mdash;Pastoral tribes about Cape Verde.</p>

<p>2. <i>Serawolli.</i>&mdash;On the Middle Senegal, different,
in many respects, from the Sereres, the
Wolofs, and the Fulahs; nations with which
they are in geographical contact.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Feloops.</i>&mdash;Between the Gambia and
Cacheo, along the coast.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Papels.</i>&mdash;South of the Cacheo; and also
coastmen.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>The Balantes.</i>&mdash;Coast-men to the south of
the Papels.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Bagnon.</i>&mdash;Conterminous with the Feloops
of the river Cacheo.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Bissago.</i>&mdash;Fierce occupants of the islands
so-called.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Naloos.</i>&mdash;On the Nun and river Grande.</p>

<p>9. <i>The Sapi.</i>&mdash;Conterminous with the Naloo,
and like all the preceding tribes, from the Feloops
downwards, pre-eminently rude, fierce, intractable,
and imperfectly known.</p>

<p>Southward, the unrepresented languages are
equally numerous&mdash;especially for the Ivory Coast,
and for the Delta of the Niger. Of these I shall
only notice one&mdash;the Vey.</p>

<p>The settlement with which the tribes speaking
the Vey language is in contact is one of which the
tongue is English, but not the political relations.
It is the American free Negro settlement of
Liberia.</p>

<p>In the Vey language, it had been known for
some time to the American missionaries, that
there were <i>written books</i>, a fact not likely to be
undervalued by those who felt warmly on the
social and civilizational prospects of the coloured
divisions of our species. One of these books was
discovered by Lieutenant Forbes, of H.M.S.
the Bonetta; local inquiry was further made
by the Rev. W. S. Koelle; and the MS. was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
critically analyzed by Mr. Norris, of the Asiatic
Society.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon, if properly measured, is by
no means a very significant one; since, although the
Vey alphabet, the invention of a man now living,
so far differs from the Mandingo, as to be spelt by
the <i>syllable</i> rather than the <i>letter</i>, it is anything
but an independent creation of the Negro brain.
Doala Bukara, its composer, an imperfect Mahometan,
had seen Mahometan books, and, although
he was no Christian, had seen an English
Bible also. He knew, then, what spelling or
writing was. He knew, too, the phonetic analysis
of the Mandingo, a tongue closely allied to his
own. And this is nine parts out of ten in the
so-called invention of alphabets.</p>

<p>The true claims of Doala, in this way, are those
of the phonetic reformers in England, as compared
with those of Toth or Cadmus&mdash;real but
moderate. His own account of the matter, as he
gave it to Mr. Koelle, was, that the fact of sounds
being <i>written</i>, haunted him in a dream, wherein
he was shown a series of signs adapted to his
native tongue. These he forgot in the morning;
but remembered the impression. So he consulted
his friends; and they and he, laying their heads together,
coined new ones. The king of the country
made its introduction a matter of state, and built<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a large house in Dshondu, as a day-school. But
a war with the Guru people disturbed both the
learners and teachers, so that the latter removed
to Bandakoro, where all grown-up people, of both
sexes, can now read and write.</p>

<p>This alphabet is a <i>syllabarium</i>.</p>

<p>The books written in it are essentially Mahometan;
the Koran appearing in them much in
the same way as the Bible appears in the more
degenerate legends of the middle ages.</p>

<p>How far the Vey alphabet will be an instrument
of civilization, is a difficult question. For my
own part, I half regret its evolution; since the
Arabic that served for the Mandingo, would have
served for the Vey as well&mdash;or if not the Arabic,
the English.</p>

<p>As a measure of African capacity it is of some
value; and in this respect, it speaks for the Negro
just as the Cherokee alphabet speaks for the
American Indian. This latter was invented by
a native named Sequoyah. Like Doala, he knew
what reading was. Like Doala, too, he had
a language adapted to a <i>syllabarium</i>. Hence,
both the Vey and the Cherokee, the two latest
coinages in the way of alphabets, are both syllabic.</p>

<p>We now move southwards to the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gold Coast Settlements.</i>&mdash;The climate of Western
Africa requires notice. It suits the native,
but destroys the European. Of the two settlements,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
already mentioned, the Gambia is the
most deadly; though Sierra Leone has the worst
name. <i>Both</i> are on the coast; both, consequently,
on the lower courses of the rivers, and both on
low levels. The import of these remarks applies
to the Negroes of America. At present, it
ushers in a brief notice of the climate of the
Gold Coast; this district being chosen for the
purpose of description because it makes the
nearest approach to the equator of any English
settlement in Africa. Consequently, it may
serve as a typical sample of the malarious parts
of the coast in question.</p>

<p>From April till August is the rainy season,
which gradually passes into the dry; heavy fogs
forming during the transition. These last till the
end of September. Occasional showers, too, continue
till November. Then the weather becomes
really clear and dry, until, towards the end of
January, the dry parching wind, called the Harmattan,
sets in, with its over-stimulant action
upon the human system, and clouds of penetrating
impalpable sand. If this is not blowing, the
atmosphere is loaded with moisture; and this it
is, combined with the heat of an intertropical sun,
and the effluvia engendered by the decay of an
over-luxuriant vegetation, which makes Western
Africa the white man's grave. Not that the soil,
even on the coast, is always swampy and alluvial.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
About Cape Coast it is rocky and undulating.
Still, it is inordinately wooded, as well as full of
spots where water accumulates and exhalations
multiply. Yet the thermometer ranges between
78&deg; and 86&deg; Fahrenheit&mdash;a low <i>maximum</i> for the
neighbourhood of the equator; a high one, however,
to feel cold in. Nevertheless, such is the
case. "From this peculiarity of the atmosphere,
the sensations of an individual almost invariably
indicate a degree of <i>cold</i>, especially when sitting
in a room, or not taking bodily exercise; so that,
to ensure a feeling of comfortable warmth, it becomes
necessary to dress in a thicker material than
what is usually considered best adapted for tropical
wear, and to have a fire lighted in one's bedroom
for some time before one retires to rest."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The chief Africans of these parts&mdash;and we now
approach the great <i>officina servorum</i>&mdash;alone tolerant
of the heats, and droughts, and rains, and
exhalations are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Fantis.</p>

<p>2. The Ghans.</p>

<p>3. The Avekvom (?)</p>

<p>A. <i>The Fantis.</i>&mdash;Of the true natives of the
country these are the chief.</p>

<p>The term <i>Fanti</i>, like the term <i>Mandingo</i>, has a
double sense&mdash;a general and a specific signification.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular population of the parts about
Cape Coast is Fanti in the limited sense of the term.</p>

<p>The great section of the Negro family, which
comprises, besides the Fantis Proper, the Ashanti,
Boroom, and several other populations, is <i>Fanti</i> in
the wide sense of the term.</p>

<p>The Fanti, Ashanti, and Boroom forms of
speech are merely dialects of one and the same
language.</p>

<p>A great proportion of the vocabularies of "Bowdich's
Ashanti" are the same.</p>

<p>So are the Fetu, Affotoo, and other vocabularies
of the "Mithridates."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Native Town of Cape
Coast, a mixed population of Krumen, Fantis, and
Mulattoes, amounting to as many as 10,000, are
no true specimens of the African of the Gold
Coast. European influences have too long been
at work on them. Before the town was English
it was Dutch; and it was English as early as 1661.</p>

<p>More than this. It is not certain that their
fathers' fathers were the <i>exact</i> aborigines; in
other words, a tribe akin to, but slightly different
from them, seems to have been the earlier possessors.
These were the Fetu&mdash;the remains of
which can doubtless be met with among the populations
of the neighbourhood; since we find
in the "Mithridates" a <i>Fetu</i> vocabulary and an
<i>Affotoo</i> one as well.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the Fantis that thus displaced the Fetu,
were themselves fugitives from the conquering
Ashantis; all, however, being the members of one
stock, and the pressure being from the highlands
of the interior towards the lowlands of the coast.</p>

<p>All three are truly Negro in conformation, and
miserably Pagan in creed, the best measure of
their political capacity being the organized kingdom
of the Ashantis; and the lowest form of it, the
system of clanships, chieftainships, or captainships
of the proper Fantis of the coast. The details of
these are of importance.</p>

<p>I cannot ascertain upon what principle those
different divisions which are sometimes called
<i>tribes</i>, sometimes <i>clans</i>, are formed; since it is
by no means safe to assume that they necessarily
consist of descendants from one common ancestor.
The investigations concerning the <i>tribes</i> of ancient
Rome show this.</p>

<p>It is easier to enumerate their external characteristics,
and material elements of their union.
In the Native Town there are four quarters, each
occupied by a separate section of the population.
This section has its own proper head, its own
proper standards, and its own proper band of
music.</p>

<p>What follows seems to apply to the rude state
of society in the country around. Each division
has its badge or device; so that we have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the tribe, or clan, of the leopard, the cat, the
dog, the hawk, the parrot, &amp;c. On certain days
there are certain festivals and processions, when
the chief is carried in a long basket on the
heads of two men, with umbrellas above him, and
attendants around proportionate to his rank.
When in distress, the Fanti has a claim upon the
good offices of his tribe.</p>

<p>When a Fanti government becomes extensive
enough to require organization, we find absolute
monarchs with satraps (caboceers) under them;
under these the heads of the different villages or
towns, and under these captains of hundreds,
fifties, and tens&mdash;an organization which is, perhaps,
of military rather than social origin. The
Ashanti kingdom gives us the best measure of
extent to which a branch of the Fanti stock has
developed itself into a political influence. As
for the <i>Constitution</i>, it is a simple and unmitigated
despotism; of which the most remarkable point is
the law of succession. This follows the female
lines, so that the heir-apparent is the eldest son of
the reigning king's eldest sister. The same applies
to the caboceers; except that, in cases of
mental or physical incapacity, the rightful heir is
set aside, and a path opened to the ambition of
private adventurers.</p>

<p>Slavery is what we expect; and on the coast
of Guinea it meets us at every turn, though not<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the worst forms of the <i>Trade</i>. This flourishes
in Dahomey, and along the whole of the Bight of
Benin. In the Fanti countries, however, the
milder form of <i>domestic</i> servitude preponderates;
and along with it a chronic state of warfare.
These two evils are connected with one another,
as cause and effect. The conquest supplies the
slaves; the slaves provoke the conquest.</p>

<p>Besides this there is a sort of temporary servitude,
which reminds us of the <i>Nexi</i> of the
Romans. This occurs when "a person, in order
to raise a particular sum of money, voluntarily
sells himself for a certain period, or until such
time as he is enabled to pay the amount so borrowed,
together with whatever interest may have
been agreed upon. This is called the system of
pawning, and the people so sold, pawns. Thus
a native, in order to make a great display on any
particular occasion, as on his marriage, or to have
a grand 'custom' for a deceased relative, will
forfeit his labour for a definite time, or give one
of his slaves for a period agreed upon. Neither
these pawns, however, nor the domestic slaves,
entertain any feeling of disgrace, but on the
contrary are happy and contented."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Everything connected with the administration
of justice is rude and savage; the severity of the
punishment upon detection being the chief preventive.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The awards, of course, depend much
upon the individual character of the chiefs; and
there are but few who have not exhibited horrible
proofs of cruelty. These, however, are no measures
of the temper of the people at large. The legitimate,
normal, established, and familiar forms of
torture give us this. It may just be a shade or
two better than that of the autocrats&mdash;though
bad at best. I still draw upon the writer already
quoted. "The most common mode of torture is
what is termed tying Guinea-fashion. In this
the arms are closely drawn together behind the
back, by means of a cord tied tightly round
them, about midway between the elbows and
shoulders. A piece of wood to act as a rack,
having been previously introduced, is then used so
as to tighten the cord, and so intense is the agony
that one application is generally sufficient to
occasion the wretch so tortured to confess to anything
that is required of him. There are various
other modes of torture in common use among the
natives of Guinea. One is tying the head, feet,
and hands, in such a way that by turning the
body backwards, they may be drawn together by
the cords employed. Another is securing a
wrist or ankle to a block of wood by an iron
staple. By means of a hammer any degree of
pressure may thus be applied, while the suffering
so produced is continuous, only being relieved by<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the wood being split, and the staples removed,
but this may not be done until a crime has been
confessed by a person who never committed it,
and even then his limb has generally been destroyed.
It would not be interesting to here
enumerate the various tortures employed by a
barbarous people, but when we recollect the
refinement of the art of torture in our own
country in the days of the maiden, the boot,
and thumb-screws, we will cease to wonder that
substitutes for these should be used in a country
where civilization has not yet begun to elevate
a people who are generally allowed to be the
lowest of the human race.</p>

<p>"There are some superstitious rites employed
by Fetish-men for the detection of crime; and
whether it is that these people really possess
such powerful influence over their wretched
dupes, as to frighten into confession of his
guilt the perpetrator of crime, or whether it is
that they manage by their numerous spies to
obtain a clue sufficient in most cases to lead to
the detection of the person, is more than I can
venture to assert; but, be the means employed
what they may, a Fetish-man will assuredly very
often bring a crime home to the right person,
even after the most patient investigation in the
ordinary way has failed to elicit the slightest
clue.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is also what is called Trial by
Dhoom. This consists in whoever are suspected
of having committed a crime being made to swallow
a decoction of <i>dhoom</i> wood of the country,
and it is believed that whoever is innocent will
immediately eject the deleterious draught, but the
guilty person will die. This, however, is not
much to be depended upon; for while it causes
death in one instance, it may do so in all
who partake of it; or on the other hand, from
some accident in its preparation, it may be
productive of no effect either upon the guilty
or the innocent.</p>

<p>"The Rice test, although practised in this
part of Africa, is, I believe, not peculiar to it,
being also employed in the West Indies, and
South America. Although no doubt originally
introduced by a people in a low state of civilization,
it is interesting in so far that it exemplifies
the powerful influence which the mind possesses
over the corporeal functions, and as it appears
to have been in use among the blacks for centuries,
we may give them the credit of having
been practically aware that 'conscience doth make
cowards of us all,' long before the Bard of Avon
chronicled the fact. In the employment of this
test in Guinea, those who are suspected of having
committed a crime are assembled, and to each<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a small portion of rice is given, which they
are required to masticate, and afterwards produce
on the hand; and it is invariably the case
that while all but the real culprit will produce
their rice in a soft pulpy mass, his will be as
dry as if ground in a mill, the salivary glands
having, under the influence exerted upon the
nervous system by fear, refused to perform their
ordinary functions."</p>

<p>Something like this is common in many savage
countries. In the shape of the <i>dhoom</i> test,
it re-appears in Old Calabar, and, probably, elsewhere.
There, the "king and chief inhabitants
ordinarily constitute a court of justice, in which
all country disputes are adjusted, and to which
every prisoner suspected of capital offences is
brought, to undergo examination and judgment.
If found guilty, they are usually forced to swallow
a deadly potion made from the poisonous
seeds of an aquatic leguminous plant, which
rapidly destroys life. This poison is obtained by
pounding the seeds, and macerating them in
water, which acquires a white milky colour.
The condemned person, after swallowing a certain
portion of the liquid, is ordered to walk
about, until its effects become palpable. If,
however, after the lapse of a definite period, the
accused should be so fortunate as to throw the
poison from off his stomach, he is considered as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
innocent, and allowed to depart unmolested. In
native <i>parlance</i> this ordeal is designated as 'chopping
nut.'"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The hardest workers amongst the Fantis are
the fishers, who use a canoe of wood of the
bombax, from ten to twelve feet in length, and
strengthened by cross timbers. The net&mdash;a
casting net&mdash;is made from the fibres of the
aloe or the pine-apple, and is about twenty feet
in diameter (?).</p>

<p>Next to these come the farmers, whose rough
agriculture consists in the cultivation of maize,
bananas, yams, and pumpkins; and lastly, the
gold-seekers. Of this there is abundance; and
where the European coin of the coast ceases,
the native currency of gold-dust begins. Sums
of so small a value as three half-pence are thus
paid; smaller ones being represented by cowries.</p>

<p>The highest of their arts is that of manufacturing
gold ornaments, and this is the hereditary
craft of certain families. These transmit the
secret of their skill from father to son, and keep
the corporation to which they belong up to a due
degree of closeness, by avoiding intermarriage
with any of the more unskilled labourers. A
little weaving, and a little potting, constitute the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
remaining arts of the Fanti&mdash;as far, at least, as
they are either <i>fine</i> or <i>useful</i>.</p>

<p>The craft of the <i>Fetish-man</i> comes under
none of the preceding categories. He is the
priest, sorcerer, or medicine man; the representative
of "Paganism, in its lowest and most
hideous form, the objects of their worship
being the most repulsive reptiles, and their
ceremonies the most degrading. They certainly
have some idea of the existence of a First
Cause, and believe themselves to be in the
power of the <i>Great Fetish</i>, their protection or
destruction being dependent upon the will of this
power, of whose attributes they know nothing
further. They also believe in the existence of a
spirit of evil, and on some parts of the coast consider
his power over them so great, that they address
their supplications, and erect, for his especial
service, small mud huts, usually of a conical
shape, built under the shade of some stately palm
or wild fig-tree, in one of the most inviting spots
to be found. These huts bear the unattractive
name among Europeans of 'devil's temples.' It
will be seen thus, that this belief in the existence
of the Great Fetish professed by the Fantees, is a
faint glimmering of that natural religion which all
nations possess. Of the creation of our species,
they do not appear to entertain very correct ideas,
unless it be that they owe their being to this<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Fetish, who, they say, in the beginning made two
people, one of whom was black, the other white,
and that both originally occupied the Fantee
country. It would seem, however, from their
account, that, after these two men were brought
into existence, the Fetish was at a loss to know
how to dispose of them, and in order to prevent
any jealousy arising between them, had recourse to
a sort of lottery, where there were all prizes and
no blanks. Two packets were accordingly placed
before them, and the black man drew first; nor
was he disappointed with his prize, for it consisted
of such a quantity of gold-dust, that it has
not been taken out of the country yet. The
remaining packet was of course the lawful property
of the white man, and in the long run he
had no cause to complain&mdash;for, on being opened,
it was found to contain a book which taught him
everything; and so do the poor wretches account
for the superior intellect of whites, and the inexhaustible
treasures of their own country.</p>

<p>"In the neighbourhood of Cape Coast, the
natives seem to believe that this Fetish occupies
more especially particular localities, and exists in
the form of a particular animal, so that an isolated
portion of rock is frequently called a Fetish-stone,
and snakes even of the most poisonous description,
in a certain locality, are preserved and allowed to
propagate, undisturbed, their venomous species.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
In some places on the coast, temples dedicated to
snake-worship are built, and the Fetish men, or
priests, connected with them are frequently
esteemed particularly holy, no doubt from the
familiar terms upon which they, in course of
time, become with the horrid reptiles, upon which
the people look as the personification of their
Fetish. The offerings made at these temples are
often very valuable, the cupidity of the deities
within not being easily satisfied. Gold-dust and
clothes are the most acceptable offerings; but when
these are not to be obtained, it is perfectly wonderful
how large a quantity of rum and tobacco the
<i>snakes</i> will consume before they vouchsafe their
good offices for the removal of a disease from a
cow, a wife, a child, or the detection of a thief,
who, not unlikely, has been employed by themselves.</p>

<p>"These Fetish men and women, too, for there
are Fetish women, and, consequently Fetish
children, have spies in different directions, forming
as many links of communication between the
priesthood in various parts of the country, so
that very few occurrences take place of which
they have not the means of making themselves
acquainted."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The same writer continues, "Religious observances,
properly so called, the Fantees have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
none, but each particular class has a certain day
of the week upon which they cease from following
their ordinary avocations&mdash;thus, a fisherman
will not go to sea on a Tuesday; nor will a
bushman enter the forest on a Friday&mdash;these
days being dedicated to the Fetish, and thus,
in some degree, representing the Sabbath of
Christian nations. There are, in addition, several
days throughout the year&mdash;apparently occurring
at the desire of the Fetish men&mdash;in which
the Fantees abstain from work, and during a
period of war, it often happens that the movements
of the opposing armies are much interfered
with by the numerous occasions upon
which it becomes necessary to propitiate the
Fetish. One of these especial Fetish days may
be here noticed, it being, apparently, the most
important of those that occur during the whole
year, and its object no less important than driving
the devil out of the village. The period when
this desirable object is effected, occurs during the
month of December, the night-time being chosen
as the most fitting for the ceremony. As soon as
darkness has closed in, the inhabitants of a village
collect at an appointed rendezvous, with sticks
and staves, and under the directions of a leader,
sally out, entering every house in their way,
through the various apartments of which they
knock about, and yell and howl with such violence<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that they would actually scare any devil but a
most impertinent one. Having, as they think,
completely rid the town of him, they pursue the
retreating enemy for some distance into the
bush, after which they return and spend the remainder
of the night in carousals.</p>

<p>"There is another festival, which, as it partakes
somewhat of a religious nature, may also be
noticed here, <i>viz.</i>, the yam-custom, which is held
in September, to celebrate the goodness of the
Fetish, in having granted an abundant harvest.
On this occasion, the king of the village and
the staff of Fetish men connected with it, take
part. All the people who can by any possibility
attend, assemble, a procession is formed, and then
the most extraordinary mixture of costumes, the
noises produced by numerous tom-toms, horns
made from elephants' tusks, and the still ruder,
if possible, rattle of two pieces of wood, or
common metal, which the women beat together to
a tune similar to what in Ireland is known as the
Kentish fire. The constant firing of musketry,
and the obscene dances performed by the two sexes
form one of the most debasing and savage exhibitions
it is possible to see. In this way does the
procession parade the principal streets, the king
seated in his basket carried by his slaves, and protected
by the umbrellas, according to his rank&mdash;the
Fetish-men dressed in white robes, also in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
their baskets. On arriving at the king's house
sacrifices are usually offered&mdash;some fowls or eggs
being now substituted in the vicinity of our settlements
for a human being, but we have still too
good reasons to believe, that even as near as the
capital of Ashantee many human lives are sacrificed
on this particular occasion, as well as in
other festivals of various descriptions. The offerings
being made, the Fetish-man partakes of the
yam; the king then eats of the valued root; and
after these two have pronounced them ripe and fit
for food, the people consider themselves at liberty
to commence digging.</p>

<p>"A being named <i>Tahbil</i> resides in the substance
of the rock, upon which Cape Coast is built, and
watches the town. Every morning, offerings of
food or flowers are left for him on the rock. Most
villages have a corresponding deity; and in earlier
times, there is good reason for believing that
human beings were sacrificed to him."</p>

<p>Likely enough&mdash;as may be seen from the practices
at Fanti funerals, and as may be inferred
from the analogy of the other parts of Western
Africa.</p>

<p>If the survivors of a deceased Fanti be poor,
the corpse is quietly interred in one of the denser
spots of the jungles; and if rich, the funeral is at
once costly and bloody; since gold and jewels are
buried along with the dead body, and human<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
victims as well. The ceremonial is as follows.
The coffin is carried to the grave by slaves,
when the retainers and friends press forwards,
fix the number required (in general four), stun
the selected individuals by a sudden blow on
the head, throw the still breathing bodies into the
grave of their master, and, whilst life yet remains,
cover in the earth.</p>

<p>This horrible custom is truly West-African.
How near we must approach the Mandingo frontier,
before we get rid of it on the north, or how
far south it extends, I am not exactly able to say.
In Dahomey, where it attains its <i>maximum</i> development,
it is worse than amongst the Ashantis, and
amongst the Ashantis worse than in the proper
Fanti districts. It certainly reaches as far southwards
as Old Calabar, where, upon the death of
Ephraim, a well-known Caboceer, "some hundreds
of men, women, and children were immolated to his
manes,&mdash;decapitation, burning alive, and the administration
of the poison-nut, being the methods
resorted to for terminating their existence. When
King Eyeo, father of the present Chief of Creek
Town, died, an eye-witness, who had only arrived
just after the completion of the funeral rites,
informed me that a large pit had been dug, in
which several of the deceased's wives were bound
and thrown in, until a certain number had been
procured; the earth was then thrown over them,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and so great was the agony of these victims, that
the ground for several minutes was agitated with
their convulsive throes. So fearful, in former
times, was the observance of this barbarous custom,
that many towns narrowly escaped depopulation.
The graves of the kings are invariably concealed,
so as, it is stated, to prevent an enemy from
obtaining their skulls as trophies, which is not the
case with those of the common people."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>I have said that it is in Dahomey, where the
immolation of human beings is the bloodiest; and
I now add that it is in Dahomey where those
who look for the more characteristic peculiarities
of the Negro stock, must search. But it is the
bad side which will preponderate; it is the
darkest practices which will develop themselves
most typically. What we find in germs and remnants
elsewhere, grow, in Dahomey, to inordinate
and incredible proportions.</p>

<p>The sacro-sanctitude of the snake is doubled
in Dahomey.</p>

<p>Slavery, bad along the whole Bight of Benin,
is worse, still, in Dahomey.</p>

<p>In Akkim we find a <i>female</i> colonel. In Dahomey
there is an army of Amazons, as indicated
by Mr. Duncan, and as described in detail by
Captain Forbes.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Gha.</i>&mdash;Accra, and the forts lately purchased
from the Danes&mdash;Christiansborg and others,&mdash;are
the localities of the <i>Gha</i> nation. I say <i>Gha</i> (or
<i>Ghan</i>) because the author of a paper soon about
to be noticed states, that this is the indigenous
name of the people which we call <i>Acra</i>, <i>Akra</i>,
<i>Accrah</i>, or <i>Inkra</i>&mdash;and it is always best to give
the native name if we can.</p>

<p>Adelung, on the authority of Romer and Isert,
gives the following account of the Negroes speaking
the Gha language. He calls it Akra.</p>

<p>They began with conquering and reducing to a
state of servitude the <i>Adampi</i>, or <i>Tambi</i>, Negroes
of the hill country; these being a portion of
their own stock, and speaking a mutually intelligible
language.</p>

<p>But, in time, they were themselves conquered
by the <i>Akvambu</i>, and broke up into two parts.
One of these remained <i>in situ</i>, and is represented
by the present Gha of Christiansborg. The other
fled to the Little Popo, an island off the coast of
Dahomey, and there settled.</p>

<p>What remained then on the Gold Coast were
the Gha and Akvambu; and these were afterwards
conquered by the Akkim Fantis, themselves
eventually reduced by the Ashantis.</p>

<p>In no more than nine or ten villages, lying
within nine or ten miles of Fort St. James and
Christiansborg, was the Akra language spoken in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the time of Protten (<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1794), and of the Ghas
thus speaking it each understood the Fanti.</p>

<p>This makes the Gha a decreasing, and, for practical
purposes, an unimportant population. At the
same time I should be glad to direct the attention
of some investigator to their ethnology. Their
exact relations to the Akvambu are uncertain.
The only work known to me where specimens
of the latter language are to be found is out of
reach.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Then as to the <i>Adampi</i>. Bowdich states that
it radically differs from the Gha; the numerals,
which agree, being borrowed from the one tongue
into the other. But his collation rests on only
seven words.</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;<i>Adampi</i>, <i>Tembi</i>, and <i>Tambu</i> are words
so much alike as to pass for the same. Yet a
<i>Tembu</i> vocabulary in the "Mithridates" differs
from a <i>Tambu</i> one in the same work&mdash;</p>

<p>Thirdly, the <i>Tjemba</i> of Balbi's "Atlas Ethnologique"
is called <i>Kassenti</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <i>Gha</i>, as far as very short comparison
goes, is neither <i>Tambu</i> nor <i>Tembu</i>: nor yet
<i>Kouri</i>&mdash;though it has a few resemblances to
all.</p>

<p>The author of the paper alluded to above is the
Rev. Mr. Hanson&mdash;himself a Gha by birth. It
was laid before the British Association in 1849.
Two points characterize the theory that it exhibits;
but as the publication of the paper <i>in
extenso</i>, is contemplated, I merely state what they
are.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>1. A remarkable number of customs common
to the <i>Jews</i> and the <i>Gha</i>.</p>

<p>2. The probable origin of the latter population
in some part of the interior of Africa, north of
their present locality, and, perhaps, in the parts
about Timbuktu.</p>

<p><i>The Quaquas.</i>&mdash;I am not sure that this name is
the best that can be given to the class in question.
Hence, it is merely provisional. The language
that is spoken by them is called the <i>Avekvom</i>.
They constitute the chief population of the <i>Ivory</i>&mdash;just
as the Krumen do that of the <i>Grain</i> and
the Fantis that of the <i>Gold</i>&mdash;Coast. <i>Apollonia</i> is
the English dependency where we find members
of the <i>Quaqua</i> stock.</p>

<p>The Avekvom dialects of the Quaqua tribes
seem to belong to a different tongue from that
of the Krumen and Fantis; and I imagine that
the three are mutually unintelligible. Still, it
is difficult to predicate this from the mere inspection
of vocabularies; the more so, as no language
of the western coast of Africa is less known
than the Avekvom&mdash;the only specimen of any
length being one in the last number of the "Journal
of the American Oriental Society." With
numerous miscellaneous affinities, it is more
Fanti and Grebo than aught else; and, perhaps,
is transitional in character to those two
languages.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>At any rate it is no isolated tongue, as may
be seen from the following table, where <i>Yebu</i>
means the language of the Yarriba country, at
the back of Dahomey, and <i>Efik</i> that of Old Calabar:&mdash;</p>

<p>There has been war and displacement here as
well as in the Gha country. In the seventeenth
century the parts about Cape Apollonia were
contended for by two tribes called the Issini (or
Oshin) and the Ghiomo. The former gave way
to the latter, and having retreated to the country
of the Veteres, were joined by that tribe against
the Esiep.</p>

<p>A Quaqua prayer is given in the "Mithridates."
It is uttered every morning by the tribes on the
Issini, after a previous ablution in that river&mdash;<i>Anghiume
mame maro, mame orie, mame shikke e
okkori, mame akaka, mame frembi, mame anguan e
awnsan</i>&mdash;<i>O Anghiume! give rice, give yams, give
gold, give aigris, give slaves, give riches, give (to be)
strong and swift.</i></p>

<p>What is here written about the ethnology of
Apollonia is written doubtfully; since here, as at
Acra, the simple ethnology of the pure and proper
Fantis becomes complicated.</p>

<p><i>The Cape of Good Hope.</i>&mdash;The aboriginal population<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the Cape is divided between two great
families:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Hottentot.</p>

<p>2. The Kaffre.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Hottentots.</i>&mdash;Of the two families this is
the most western; it is the one which the colonists
came first in contact with, and it is the one which
has been most displaced by Europeans. The
names of fourteen extinct tribes of Hottentots are
known; of which it is only necessary to mention
the Gunyeman and Sussaqua the nearest the
Cape, and the Heykom, so far eastwards and
northwards as Port Natal. The displacement of
these last has not been effected by Europeans.
African subdued African; and it was the Kaffres
who did the work of conquest here.</p>

<p>Of the extant Hottentots, within the limits of
the colony of the Cape, the most remote are the
<i>Gonaqua</i>, on the head-waters of the Great Fish
River; or rather on the water-shed between it
and the Orange River. They are fast becoming
either extinct, or amalgamated with the Kaffres;
inasmuch as they are the Hottentots of the Amakosa
frontier, and suffer, at least, as much from
the Kaffres as from their white neighbours.</p>

<p>The <i>Namaquas</i> occupy the <i>lower</i> part of the
Orange River, the Great and Little Namaqualand.</p>

<p><i>The Koranas.</i>&mdash;This branch of the Hottentots<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
has its locality on the middle part of the Gariep,
with the Griquas to the north, the Bechuana
Kaffres to the east, and the Saabs in the middle
of them. Their number is, perhaps, 10,000.
Their exact relation to the other Hottentots is
uncertain. They are a better formed people than
the Gonaqua and Namaqua, but whether they be
the best samples of the Hottentot stock altogether
is uncertain. Probably a tribe far up in the
north-western parts of South Africa, and beyond
Namaqualand, may dispute the honour with them.
These are the Dammaras&mdash;themselves disputed
Hottentots. Their country lies beyond the British
colony, but it must be noticed for the sake of
taking in all the branches of the stock in question.
It is the tract between Benguela and Namaqualand,
marked in the maps as <i>sterile country</i>; in
the northern parts of which we sometimes find
notices of a fierce nation called <i>Jagas</i>. Walvisch
Bay lies in the middle of it. Now some writers
make the Dammaras of this country Hottentot;
others Kaffre; and that both rightly and wrongly.
They are both&mdash;partly one, partly the other;
since Dammara is a geographical term, and some
of the tribes to which it applies are Kaffre, some
Hottentot. The Dammaras of the plains, or the
Cattle Dammaras are the former; the Dammaras<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
of the hills, the latter. Between the Dammara<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and the Korana a much nearer approach to
Kaffre type is made than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>A branch of the Koranas&mdash;those of the valley of
the Hartebeest River&mdash;deserves particular attention.
They caution us against overvaluing differences;
and Dr. Prichard has quoted the evidence
of Mr. Thompson with this especial object. They
are Koranas who have suffered in war, lost their
cattle, and been partially expatriated by the
more powerful sections of their stock. Hence,
want and poverty have acted upon them; and the
effect has been that they have become hunters
instead of shepherds, have been reduced to a precarious
subsistence, and as the consequence of
altered circumstances, have receded from the level
of the other Koranas, and approached that of
the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Saabs or Bushmen.</i>&mdash;These belong to the parts
between the Roggeveld and Orange River; parts
which rival the <i>sterile country</i> of the map in barrenness.
As is the country so are the inhabitants;
starved, miserable hunters&mdash;hunters rather than
shepherds or herdsmen.</p>

<p>The Lap is not more strongly contrasted with
the Finlander, than the Korana with the Saab;
and the deadly enmity between these two populations
is as marked as the differences in their
physical appearances. I think, however, that
undue inferences have been drawn from the difference;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in other words, that the distance between
the Korana and the Saab has been exaggerated.
The languages are unequivocally allied.</p>

<p>I think, too, that a similarly undue inference
has been drawn from the extent to which the
Kaffre and the Korana are <i>alike</i>; inasmuch as an
infusion of Kaffre has been assumed for the sake
of accounting for it. Of this, however, no proof
exists.</p>

<p>The Saabs are described as having constitutions
"so much enfeebled by the dissolute life they
lead, and the constant smoking of <i>dacha</i>, that
nearly all, including the young people, look old
and wrinkled; nevertheless, they are remarkable
for vanity, and decorate their ears, legs, and arms
with beads, and iron, copper, or brass rings. The
women likewise stain their faces red, or paint
them, either wholly or in part. Their clothing
consists of a few sheepskins, which hang about
their bodies, and thus form the mantle or covering,
commonly called a <i>kaross</i>. This is their only
clothing by day or night. The men wear old hats,
which they obtain from the farmers, or else caps
of their own manufacture. The women wear caps
of skins, which they stiffen and finish with a high
peak, and adorn with beads and metal rings. The
dwelling of the Bushman is either a low wretched
hut, or a circular cavity, on the open plain, into
which, at night, he creeps with his wife and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
children, and which, though it shelters him from
the wind, leaves him exposed to the rain. In
this neighbourhood, in which rocks abound, they
had formerly their habitations in them, as is
proved by the many rude figures of oxen, horses,
serpents, &amp;c. still existing. It is not a little interesting
to see these poor degraded people, who
formerly were considered and treated as little
better than wild beasts in their rocky retreats.
Many of those who have forsaken us live in such
cavities not far from our settlement, and we have
thus an opportunity of observing them in their
natural condition. Several who, when they came
to us from the farmers, were decently clothed and
possessed a flock of sheep, which they had earned,
in a short time returned to their fastnesses in a
state of nakedness and indigence, rejoicing that
they had got free from the farmers, and could live
as they pleased in the indulgence of their sensual
appetites. Such fugitives from civilised life, I
have never seen otherwise occupied than with
their bows and arrows. The bows are small, but
made of good elastic wood; the arrows are formed
of small reeds, the points furnished with a well-wrought
piece of bone, and a double barb, which
is steeped in a potent poison of a resiny appearance.
This poison is distilled from the leaves of
an indigenous tree. Many prefer these arrows to
fire-arms, under the idea that they can kill more<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
game by means of a weapon that makes no report.
On their return from the chase, they feast till
they are tired and drowsy, and hunger alone
rouses them to renewed exertion. In seasons of
scarcity they devour all kinds of wild roots, ants,
ants' eggs, locusts, snakes, and even roasted skins.
Three women of this singular tribe were not long
since met with, several days' journey from this
place, who had forsaken their husbands, and lived
very contentedly on wild honey and locusts. As
enemies, the Bushmen are not to be despised.
They are adepts in stealing cattle and sheep;
and the wounds they inflict when pursued, are
ordinarily fatal if the wounded part is not immediately
cut out. The animals they are unable to
carry off, they kill or mutilate.</p>

<p>"To our great comfort, even some of these
poor outcasts have shown eagerness to become
acquainted with the way of salvation. The
children of such as are inhabitants of the settlement,
attend the school diligently, and of them
we have the best hopes.</p>

<p>"The language of the Bushman has not one
pleasing feature; it seems to consist of a collection
of snapping, hissing, grunting, sounds; all
more or less nasal. Of their religious creed it is
difficult to obtain any information; as far as I
have been able to learn, they have a name for the
Supreme Being; and the Kaffre word <i>tixo</i> is<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
derived from the <i>tixme</i> of the Bushmen. Sorcerers
exist among them. One of the Bushmen
residing here being sick, a sorceress was sent for
before we were aware of it, who pretended, by
the virtue of mystic dance, to extract an antelope
horn from the head of the patient."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><i>The Griquas.</i>&mdash;The Griquas, called also Baastaards,
are a pastoral population, upwards of
15,000 in number, on the north side of the
great bend of the Orange River. They are the
descendants of Dutch fathers and Hottentot
mothers.</p>

<p>A mixture of Griquas and Hottentots occurs
also on the Kat River, a feeder of the Great
Fish River, in the district of Somerset, and on
the Kaffre frontier. Here they are distributed in
a series of district locations, amid the dales and
fastnesses of the eastern frontier. A great proportion
of them are discharged soldiers&mdash;so that
in reality, like the borderers of old, they form
a sort of military colony.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Kaffres.</i>&mdash;The British districts in contact
with the Kaffre populations are the eastern,
and of these Albany and Somerset most especially.
The Kaffre nation in most immediate contact with
Albany and Somerset is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Amakosa.</i>&mdash;This is the population which
constituted the authority of Hintza, and to which<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Pato, Gaika, and the other chiefs of the last war
belonged. To this, too, belong the troublesome
chiefs of the present. Next to the Amakosa, and
in alliance with them, come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Amatembu</i>, or <i>Tambuki</i> (<i>Tambookies</i>), occupants
of the upper part of the river Kei, as
the Amakosa are of the lower Keiskamma.</p>

<p>Between the Amatembu and Port Natal lie <i>the
Amaponda</i>, or <i>Mambuki</i> (<i>Mambookies</i>), the northern
extremity of which reaches the country of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Amazulu</i>, or <i>Zulu</i> (<i>Zooloos</i>), the chief
frontagers (conjointly with the <i>Mambuki</i>) of Port
Natal.</p>

<p>The last division of the Kaffres of the coast is
that of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Fingos.</i>&mdash;In 1835, a numerous population,
called Fingos, was found by Sir B. D'Urban in
the Kaffre chief Hintza's country, and in a state
of abject servitude to the Amakosas. They
were from different tribes; darker and shorter
than the Amakosas&mdash;but still true Kaffres.
They were offered land between the lower Keiskamma
and the Great Fish River, and were
emancipated and brought safe into the colony to
the amount of 17,000.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Since then, they have
served as a sort of military police on the Kaffre
frontier; and as shepherds in Australia&mdash;whither
they have been advantageously introduced.</p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>But, besides the Kaffres of the coast there are
those of the interior. These speak a modified
form of the Kosa (or Amakosa), called Si-<i>chuana</i>,
the name of the people being Bi-<i>chuana</i>. They lie
due north of the Koranas; beyond the boundaries
of the colony; but not beyond the influence of
its missionaries, or the range of its explorers.
Litaku, Kurrichani, and other similar <i>towns</i> are
<i>Sichuana</i>; the Kaffre civilization being said to
attain its <i>maximum</i> hereabouts.</p>

<p>There are plenty of points of contrast between
the Kaffre and the typical Negro; so many indeed
as to have suggested the doctrine that the
former class belongs to some division of the
human species other than the African. And
these points of contrast are widely distributed, <i>i.e.</i>,
they appear and re-appear, whatever may be the
view taken of the Kaffre stock. They appear in
the descriptions of their skin and skeletons; they
appear in the notice of their language; and they
appear in the history of the Kaffre wars of the
Cape frontier&mdash;wars more obstinate and troublesome
than any which have been conducted by the
true Negro; and which approach the character of
the Kabyle struggle for independence in Algeria.
In investigating these differences we must guard
against the exaggeration of their import.</p>

<p>Physically, the Kaffre has the advantage of the
Negro in the conformation of the face and skull.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
His forehead betokens greater capacity; being
more prominent, more vaulted, and with a greater
facial angle. His teeth, too, are more vertically
inserted, and the nasal bones less depressed. I
have not heard of aquiline noses in Kaffraria; but
should not be surprised if I did.</p>

<p>The cheek-bones of the Kaffre project outwards;
and where the cheek-bones so project
beyond a certain limit, the chin appears to taper
downwards, and the vertex upwards. When this
becomes exaggerated we hear of <i>lozenge-shaped</i>
crania; the Malay skulls being currently quoted
as instances thereof. Be this as it may, the
breadth in the malar portion of the face is a
remarkable feature in the Kaffre physiognomy.
This he has in common with the Hottentot.
His hair is also tufted like the Hottentot's: while
his lips are thick like the Negro's. Tall in stature,
wiry and elastic in his muscles, the Kaffre varies
in colour, through all the shades of black and
brown; being, in some portions of his area nearly
as dark as the Negro, in others simply brown
like the Arab. The eye is sometimes oblique;
the opening generally narrow.</p>

<p>An opinion often gives a better picture than a
description. Kaffres, that have receded in the
greatest degree from the Negro type, have been
so likened to the more southern Arabs as to have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
engendered the hypothesis of an infusion of Arab
blood.</p>

<p>The manners of the Kaffres of the Cape are
those of pastoral tribes under chieftains; tribes
which, from their habits and social relations, are
naturally active, locomotive, warlike, and jealous
of encroachment. Next to marauding on the
hunting-grounds of an American Indian, interference
with the pasture of a shepherd population
is the surest way to warfare.</p>

<p>It would be strange indeed if the Kaffre life
and Kaffre physiognomy had no peculiarities.
However little in the way of physical influence
we may attribute to the geography of a country,
no man ignores them altogether. Now Kaffreland
has very nearly a latitude of its own; inhabited
lands similarly related to the southern tropic
being found in South America and Australia
only. And it has a soil still more exclusively
South-African. We connect the idea of the
<i>desert</i> with that of sand; whilst <i>steppe</i> is a term
which is limited to the vast tracts of central Asia.
Now the Kaffre, and still more the Hottentot,
area, dry like the desert, and elevated like the
steppe, is partially a <i>karro</i>. Its soil is often a
hard, cracked, and parched clay rather than a waste
of sand, and it constitutes an argillaceous table-land.
Its vegetation has strongly marked characters.
Its Fauna has the same.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The language is peculiar. If English were
spoken on Kosa or Sichuana principles we should
say</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>b</i>un beam</td><td class="center">instead of</td><td><i>s</i>un beam.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>l</i>oon light</td><td class="center">...</td><td><i>m</i>oon light.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>s</i>rand-son</td><td class="center">...</td><td><i>g</i>rand-son, &amp;c.,</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noin">since, in the Kaffre languages throughout, subordinate
words in certain syntactic combinations,
accommodate their initial letter to that of the
leading word of the term.</p>

<p>Their polity and manners, too, are peculiar.
The head man of the village settles disputes; his
tribunal being in the open air. From him an
appeal lies to a chief of higher power; and from
him to some superior, higher still. In this way
there is a long chain of feudal or semi-feudal dependency.</p>

<p>But the power of the chief is checked by that
of the priest. A supposed skill in medicine,
imaginary arts of divination, and an accredited
power over the elements are the prerogatives of
certain witches and wizards. Thus, when a murrain
among the cattle, or the death of an important
individual has taken place, the blame is laid
upon some unfortunate victim whom the witch
or wizard points out. And the ordeal to which
he must submit, is equal in cruelty to those of
the Gold Coast. He is beaten with sticks, and
then pegged down to the ground. Whilst thus<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
helpless, a nest of venomous bush-ants is broken
over his racked and quivering body. If this fail
to extort a confession, he is singed to death with
red-hot stones.</p>

<p>This tells us what is meant by Kaffre chiefs
and Kaffre wizards.</p>

<p>The wife is the slave to the husband; and he
<i>buys</i> her in order that she should be so. The
purchase implies a seller. This is always a
member of another tribe. Hence the wish
of a Kaffre is to see his wife the mother of
many children, girls being more valuable than
boys.</p>

<p>Why a man should not sell his offspring to the
members of his own tribe is uncertain. It is
clear, however, that the practice of doing so makes
marriage between even distant relations next to
impossible. To guard against the chances of this,
a rigid and suspicious system of restraint has
been developed in cases of consanguinity; and
relations must do all they can to avoid meeting.
To sit in the same room, to meet on the same
road, is undesirable. To converse is but just
allowable, and then all who choose must hear what
is said. So thorough, however, has been the
isolation in many cases, that persons of different
sexes have lived as near neighbours for many
years without having conversed with each other;
and such communication as there has been, has<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
taken place through the medium of a third person.
No gift will induce a Kaffre female to violate
this law.</p>

<p>Is the immolation of human beings at the
death of chieftains a Kaffre custom, as it was
one of western Africa? The following extract
gives an answer in the affirmative, the only difference
being the <i>pretext</i> of the murders. On
the "death of the mother of Chaka, the great
Zulu chief, a public mourning was held, which
lasted for the space of two days, the people being
assembled at the kraal of the chief to the number
of sixty or eighty thousand souls. Mr. Fynn, who
was present, describes the scene as the most terrific
which it is possible for the human mind to conceive.
The immense multitude were all engaged
in rending the air with the most doleful shrieks,
and discordant cries and lamentations; whilst, in
the event of their ceasing to utter them, they
were instantly butchered as guilty of a crime
against the reigning tyrant. It is said that no
less than six or seven thousand persons were
destroyed on this occasion, charged with no other
offence than exhausted nature in the performance
of this horrid rite, their brains being mercilessly
dashed out amidst the surrounding throng. As a
suitable <i>finale</i> to this dreadful tragedy, it is said
that ten females were actually buried alive with
the royal corpse; whilst all who witnessed the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
funeral were obliged to remain on the spot for a
whole year."</p>

<p>Details of Kaffre manners may be multiplied
almost <i>ad infinitum</i>; and as their history and
habits are likely to fill a Blue Book, a short treatise
can only notice their more prominent peculiarities.</p>

<p>However, lest an undue inference be drawn
from their contrast to the Hottentot, we must
remember that the former has encroached upon
the latter, and that such transitional populations
as existed have been swept away.</p>

<p>Now comes a coloured population&mdash;not indigenous,
but the descendants of the <i>slaves</i> of the
colony. This consists of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Negroes.</p>

<p>2. Malays from the Indian Archipelago.</p>

<p>3. Malagasi from Madagascar.</p>

<p>To which we must add, as of mixed blood, the
offspring of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Negroes and Dutch, English, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Malays and Dutch, English, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Malagasi and Dutch, English, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This seems to be the limit of the intermixture;
since, between the Malays and Negroes,
&amp;c., there is but little intermarriage. The <i>possible</i>
elements, however, of hybridity are numerous,
<i>e.g.</i>, Griquas and Negroes, Griquas and Malays,
Malays and Kaffres, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>The so-called yellow men.</i>&mdash;On the 4th of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
August, 1782, the "Grosvenor" Indiaman was
wrecked on the coast of Natal. Of the crew
who escaped, some reached the Cape and others
remained amongst the natives. In 1790, an expedition
was undertaken in search of them.</p>

<p>In this expedition, Mr. Van Reenens, considered
that he had discovered a village where the
people were descended from the whites, and in
which there were three old women who had
been wrecked when very young. They could not
tell to what country they belonged; were treated
as superior beings; and, when offered a safe
convoy to the Cape, were at first pleased with the
prospect, but eventually refused to leave their
children and grandchildren. Now, whatever these
old women were, they were not of the crew of
the "Grosvenor," and I doubt whether they were
Europeans at all.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;Mr. Thomson, when at Litaku, heard
of yellow <i>cannibals</i>, with long hair, whose invasions
were the dread of the country; a statement
which merely means that some tribes of South
Africa, are lighter coloured, and more savage in
their appetite than others.</p>

<p>Lastly, Lieutenant Farewell saw one of these
yellow men at Natal, who was described as a cannibal,
and <i>who shrunk abashed from the lieutenant</i>.</p>

<p>Be it so. The evidence that "there are descendants
of Europeans and Africans now widely<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
diffusing their offspring throughout the country;
whose services might be turned to good account in
civilizing the native tribes," is still incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Mauritius.</i>&mdash;The coloured population, which is
far greater than that of the white, consists in the
Mauritius of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. True Africans&mdash;chiefly from the east coast,
and, consequently, of the Kaffre stock; the word
being used in its most general sense. Darker
than the Kaffres of the Cape, they, nevertheless,
recede from the Negro type in the shape of the
jaw, lips, and forehead. The hair also is less
woolly. They are strong and powerful individuals.</p>

<p>2. Malagasi, or natives of Madagascar.&mdash;These
are <i>not</i> Africans to the same extent as the
Kaffres of the coast. As far back as the time of
Reland it was known that the affinities of the
Malagasi language were with the Malay and Polynesian
tongues of Asia; but it was also known
that the similarity in physiognomy was less than
that of language. Hence came a conflict of difficulties.
The speech indicated one origin, the
colour another&mdash;whilst the fact of an island so
near to Africa, and so far from Malacca, as Madagascar,
being other than what its geographical position
indicated, is, and has been, a mystery. Some
writers have assumed an intermixture of blood;
others have limited the Malay element to the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dominant population. Lastly, Mr. Crawfurd has
denied the inferences from the similarity of language
<i>in toto</i>; considering that there is "nothing
in common between the two races, and nothing in
common between the character of their languages."
The comparative philologist is slow to admit this&mdash;indeed,
he denies it.</p>

<p>The blacks form the great majority of the
coloured population. Besides these, however,
there are&mdash;</p>

<p>3. Arabs.</p>

<p>4. Chinese.</p>

<p>5. Hind&uacute;s, from the continent of India; convicts
being transported to the Mauritius for life,
and worked on the roads of the colony.</p>

<p>6. Cingalese from Ceylon&mdash;the Kandian chiefs
whose presence in their native country was thought
likely to endanger the tranquillity of the island,
were sent hither.</p>

<p>The whites of the Mauritius are chiefly French;
though not wholly of pure blood. The first settlers
took their wives from Madagascar. The
English form the smallest part of the population.</p>

<p><i>Rodrigues</i>&mdash;occupied by a few French colonists
from the Mauritius.</p>

<p><i>The Seychelles</i>&mdash;The same; the coloured population
outnumbering the white in the proportion
of ten to one. Here there is a Portuguese admixture.
From Maha, the chief town of the Seychelles,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to Madagascar, is five hundred and seventy-six
miles&mdash;a fact to be borne in mind when we
speculate upon the origin of the population of
that island.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Africans of British America.&mdash;Honduras,
Belize, the West India Islands, and Demerara.</i>&mdash;The
usual distribution of the population of these
parts is&mdash;</p>

<div class="hd1">WHITE.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. European whites, born in Europe.</p>

<p>2. Creoles, or whites born in the island.</p></div>

<div class="hd1">COLOURED.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>a. Pure Blood.</i></p>

<p>1. Mandingos, from the river-systems of the
Senegal and Gambia.</p>

<p>2. Coromantines&mdash;from the Ivory and Gold
Coast.</p>

<p>3. Whydahs&mdash;from Dahomey.</p>

<p>4. Ibos&mdash;from the Lower Niger.</p>

<p>5. Congos&mdash;from Portuguese Africa.</p></div>

<div class="center"><i>b. Mixed Blood.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Sambos, intermixture of the Negro and Mulatto.</p>

<p>2. Mulattoes&mdash;Negro and white.</p>

<p>3. Quadroons&mdash;Mulatto and white.</p>

<p>4. Mestis&mdash;Quadroon and white.</p></div><p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is what I find in Mr. Martin's valuable
work on the Colonies, and it is, undoubtedly, a
convenient and practical classification. Yet for the
purposes of ethnology, it is deficient in detail.
Without even guessing at the proportion of
American slaves which the different parts of the
western coast of Africa may have supplied, I subjoin
a brief notice of tract between the Senegal
and Benguela.</p>

<p>1. First come the <i>Wolof</i>, between the Senegal
and Cape Verde. To the back of these
lie&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The <i>Serawolli</i>&mdash;and around Cape Verde&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The <i>Sereres</i>&mdash;none of these are truly
Mandingo; nor is it certain that many slaves
have come from them; such as do, however,
are probably Mandingos in the current classification.</p>

<p>4. The Fulahs of Fouta-Torro and Fouta-Jallo
possess the higher part of the Senegambian system.
Imperfect Mahometans, they are lighter-coloured
than either the Wolof or the Mandingo. Notwithstanding
the great Fulah conquests&mdash;for
under a leader named Danfodio this has been
one of the encroaching and subjugating families
of Africa&mdash;there are still American slaves of
Fulah blood&mdash;though, perhaps, but few. Mr.
Hodgson procured his vocabulary from a Fulah
slave of Virginia; and what we find in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
United States, we may find in the British possessions
also.</p>

<p>5. The Mandingos Proper are the Negroes of
the Gambia; but the following Africans, all
within the range of the old slave trade, belong to
the same class.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The Susu; whose language is spoken from
the River Pongos to Sierra Leone.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The Timmani.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The Bullom&mdash;each in contact with that settlement.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The Vey&mdash;the written language already
noticed.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The Mendi&mdash;conterminous with the Vey.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> The Kissi&mdash;like the last two, spoken in the
country behind Cape Mount, and on the boundaries
of Liberia.</p>

<p>South of the Gambia and north of the Pongos,
the Mandingo tongues, though spoken in the interior,
do not reach the coast. On the contrary,
they encircle the populations on the mouths of
the Cacheo, Rio Grande, and Nun&mdash;and truly
barbarous populations these are. Of these the
most northern are&mdash;</p>

<p>6. <i>The Fel&uacute;p</i> (Feloops)&mdash;between the Gambia
and Cacheo.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Papel</i>&mdash;south of the Cacheo.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Balantes</i>&mdash;south of the Papel.</p>

<p>9. <i>The Bagnon</i>&mdash;on the Lower Cacheo.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>10. <i>The Bissago</i>&mdash;islanders off the Cacheo.</p>

<p>11. <i>Nal&uacute;</i> (<i>Naloos</i>)&mdash;on the Lower Nun.</p>

<p>12. <i>Sapi</i>&mdash;<i>ibid</i>.</p>

<p>After these come the Susu, &amp;c.; down to the
tribes about Cape Mount and Cape Mesurado.</p>

<p>Between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas
come&mdash;</p>

<p>13. <i>The Krumen.</i> Next to them&mdash;</p>

<p>14. <i>The Quaquas</i>, of the Ivory Coast; speaking
different Avekvom dialects.</p>

<p>Somewhere hereabouts come the&mdash;</p>

<p>15, 16, 17. Kanga, Mangree, and Gien; three
undetermined vocabularies of the "Mithridates."
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>18, 19, 20. The Fanti, Gha, and Adampi (?) of
the Gold Coast. We now approach the great
marts&mdash;</p>

<p>21, 22. Benin and Dahomey; and&mdash;almost
equal in infamous notoriety&mdash;the countries of the
Delta, of the Niger, or of the&mdash;</p>

<p>23, 24, 25. Ibu, Bonny, and Efik (Old Calabar)
Africans; at the back of which lie&mdash;</p>

<p>26, 27. Yarriba, and the Nufi country. In
Fernando Po the population is&mdash;</p>

<p>28. Ediya. About the Bimbia river and mountain&mdash;</p>

<p>29. Isubu.</p>

<p>30, 31, 32. The <i>Banaka</i> (or <i>Batanga</i>), the
<i>Panwi</i>, and the <i>Mpoongwe</i> take us from the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Gaboon to Loango; forming a transition from the
true Negroes to the Kaffres.</p>

<p>33, 34, 35, 36. <i>Loango</i>, <i>Congo</i>, <i>Angola</i>, and
<i>Benguela</i>&mdash;the Kaffre type, both in form and language,
is now more closely approached. Below
Benguela there has been little or no exportation.</p>

<p><i>Aden.</i>&mdash;The ethnology of the Arab stock would
fill a volume. It is sufficient to state that the
British political dependency of Aden is, ethnologically,
an Arab town.</p>

<p>Far more important possessions direct our attention
towards India. Nevertheless, there are
certain preliminaries to its ethnology.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Mongolia and China&mdash;each of these countries
illustrates an important ethnological phenomenon.</p>

<p>The first is a physical one. Cheek-bones that
project outwards, a broad and flat face, a depressed
nose, an oblique eye, a somewhat slanting insertion
of the teeth, a scanty beard, an undersized
frame, and a tawny or yellow skin, characterize
the Mongol of Mongolia.</p>

<p>The second is a philological one. A comparative
absence of grammatical inflexions, and a
disproportionate preponderance of monosyllabic
words, characterize the language of China.</p>

<p>So much for the simple elementary facts; the
former of which will be spoken of under the designation
of <i>Mongolian conformation</i>; the second
under that of <i>monosyllabic language</i>.</p>

<p>Neither term is limited to the nation by which
it has been illustrated. Plenty of populations
besides those of Mongolia Proper are Mongol in
physiognomy. Plenty of nations besides the
Chinese are monosyllabic in language.</p>

<p>All the nations speaking monosyllabic tongues
are Mongol in physiognomy; though all the
nations which have a Mongol physiognomy do <i>not</i>
speak monosyllabic tongues. This makes the
latter group, which for shortness will be called
that of the <i>monosyllabic</i> nations or tribes&mdash;a section,
or division, of the former.</p>

<p>Little Tibet, Ladakh, Tibet Proper, Butan, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
China, are all Mongol in form, and monosyllabic
in language. So are Ava, Pegu, Siam, Cambojia,
and Cochin China, the countries which constitute
the great peninsula, sometimes called <i>Indo-Chinese</i>,
and sometimes <i>Transgangetic</i>.</p>

<p>The extremity however&mdash;the Malayan peninsula&mdash;is
<i>not</i> monosyllabic.</p>

<p><i>The British possessions of Hindostan are monosyllabic
on their Tibetan and Burmese frontiers.</i></p>

<p><i>Hong-Kong.</i>&mdash;Aden was disposed of briefly. So
is Hong-Kong; and that for the same reason.
Politically, British, it is ethnologically Chinese.</p>

<p><i>Maulmein, Ye, Tavoy, Tenasserim, and the
Mergui Archipelago.</i>&mdash;These constitute what are
sometimes called the <i>ceded</i>, sometimes the <i>Tenasserim</i>
provinces. They came into possession of
the British at the close of the Burmese war of
1825. Unlike our dependencies in Hindostan, they
are cut off from connection with any of the great
centres of British power in Asia&mdash;in which respect
they agree with the smaller and still more isolated
settlements of the Malaccan Peninsula. The
power that ceded them was the Burmese, so that
it is with the existing subjects of that empire that
their present limits are in contact; though only
for the northern part. To the south they abut
upon Siam.</p>

<p>The population throughout is monosyllabic;
except so far as it is modified by foreign intermixture&mdash;of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which by far the most important element
is the Indian. Everything in the way of
religious creed which is not native and pagan is
Indian and Buddhist. The alphabets, too, of the
lettered populations are Indian in origin.</p>

<p>The population of the <i>continental</i> part of these
British dependencies is referable to four divisions&mdash;of
unequal and imperfectly ascertained value.
1. The M&ocirc;n. 2. The Siamese. 3. The Avans.
4. The Kariens.</p>

<p>1. <i>The M&ocirc;n.</i>&mdash;M&ocirc;n is the native name of the
indigenous population of Pegu, so that the M&ocirc;n
of Maulmein, or Amherst, the most northern of
the provinces in question, on the left bank of the
lower Salw&iacute;n, are part and parcel of the present
occupants of the delta of the Irawaddi, and the
country about Cape Negrais. The Burmese call
them <i>Talieng</i>, and under that designation they are
described in Dr. Helfer's Report.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The Siamese
appellation is <i>Ming-m&ocirc;n</i>; apparently the native
name in a state of composition. In the early
Portuguese notices a still more composite form
appears&mdash;and we hear of the ancient empire of
<i>Kalamenham</i>, supposed to have been founded by
the <i>Pandal&uacute;s</i> of M&ocirc;n or Pegu.</p>

<p>None of the <i>lettered</i> languages of the Indo-Chinese
peninsula are less known than that of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pegu. At the same time its unequivocally monosyllabic
character is beyond doubt. The alphabet
is a slight variation of the Avan.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the M&ocirc;n at the
extremity of a promontory, and on the delta of
a river, taken along with their philological isolation,
is remarkable. They have evidently been
encroached upon by the Avans in latter times;
whilst, at an earlier period, they themselves probably
encroached upon others. Whether they
are the oldest occupants of Maulmein is uncertain;
it is only certain that they are older than
their conquerors.</p>

<p>To the M&ocirc;n of Pegu the exchange of Avan for
British rule, has been a great and an appreciated
advantage.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Siamese.</i>&mdash;The native name for the
Siamese language is <i>Tha'y</i>, and <i>Tha'y</i> is the
national and indigenous denomination of the
Siamese. It is the Avans who call them <i>Sian</i> or
<i>Shan</i>; from whence the European term has been
derived through the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The Siamese population is of course greatest
on the Siamese frontier; so that, increasing as
we go south, it attains its <i>maximum</i> in Tenasserim
just as the M&ocirc;n did in Maulmein. It seems,
also, to have been introduced at different times; a
fact which gives us a distinction between the
native Siamese and the recent settlers.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the <i>M&ocirc;n</i>, the Tha'y, at least in its more
classical dialect, is a lettered language; the alphabet,
like the Buddhist religion, being Indian.
Unlike, however, the <i>M&ocirc;n</i>, which is the only
representative of the family to which it belongs,
the <i>Tha'y</i> tribes constitute a vast class, falling
into divisions and subdivisions, and exceedingly
remarkable in respect to its geographical distribution.</p>

<p>The Siamese of Siam, the kingdom of which
Bankok is the capital, form but a fraction of this
great stock. The <i>upper</i> half of the river Menam
is occupied by what are called the <i>La&uacute;</i>, or
<i>Laos</i>. These are partly wholly independent, and
partly in nominal dependence upon China; and
proportionate to their independence is the unlettered
character of their language, and the absence
of Indian influences. Nor is this all. The
Menam is pre-eminently the river of the Tha'y
stock, and along the water-system of the Menam
its chief branches are to be found; their position
being between the Burmese populations of the
west, and the Khomen of Cambojia on the east.
This distribution is <i>vertical</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, it is characterized
by its length, rather than its breadth, and runs
from south to north. So far does it reach in this
direction that, as high as 28&deg; North lat., in upper
Assam we find a branch of it. This is the <i>Khamti</i>.
In a valuable comparison of languages, well-known<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as "Brown's Tables,"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the proportion of the
Khamti words to the South Siamese is ninety-two
<i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>Of the physical appearance of the Siamese, we
find the best account in "Crawfurd's Embassy," the
classical work for the ethnology of the southern
part of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Their stature
is low; the tallest man out of twenty having
been five feet eight inches, the shortest five feet
three. The complexion, darker than that of the
Chinese, is lighter than that of the Malay; the
eye oblique; the jaw square; and the cheek-bones
broad.</p>

<p><i>Tha'y</i> is an ethnological term, and denotes all
the nations and tribes akin to the Siamese of the
southern, the Khamti of the northern, or the La&uacute;
of the intermediate area. The difference between
the first and the last of these three should be
noticed. Some members of the family are Indianized
in religion, and organized in politics.
Such are the Siamese of Bankok. Others retain
both their independence and their original Paganism.
Such are some of the La&uacute;. <i>Mutatis
mutandis</i>, the same applies to the next family.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Burmese</i>, to which both the Avans
and the Kariens belong; but as it has been already
stated that the divisions under consideration<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
are by no means of equal value, the two branches
will be considered separately.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Avans.</i>&mdash;<i>Avan</i> is a more convenient
term than <i>Burmese</i>, inasmuch as it is more definite;
the <i>Burmese Empire</i> containing not only
very distant members of the great <i>Burmese</i> family,
but also populations which belong to other
groups. <i>Ava</i>, on the other hand, is the centre
of the dominant division.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>M&ocirc;n</i>, or a family yet to be mentioned,
represent the aborigines of <i>Maulmein</i>, it
is certain that the Avans of that country are of
comparatively recent introduction.</p>

<p>Again, whether the <i>Tha'y</i>, or a family yet to
be mentioned, represent the aborigines of <i>Tenasserim</i>,
it is certain that the Avans of that country
are of comparatively recent origin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are Avans in each; and in
Maulmein, although the M&ocirc;n preponderate in
number, they all are able to speak the language
of their conquerors. I say <i>conquerors</i>, because
the Avans are for all the parts south of 18&deg;
North lat., an intrusive population: the end of
the eighteenth century being the date, when,
under Alompra, an Avan or Umerap&uacute;ra dynasty
broke up and subjected, in different degrees, the
M&ocirc;n and Tha'y populations to the south, as well
as several others more akin to itself on the east,
west, and north.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The kingdom of Ava, next to those of China
and Siam, best represents the civilization of those
families whose tongue is monosyllabic. This implies
that it has an organized polity, a lettered
language, and a Buddhist creed; in other words
that the influences of either China or India have
acted on it. Of these two nations it is the latter
which has most modified the Indianized members
of the great Burmese stock. In strong contrast
with these is the fourth and last branch of the
<i>continental</i> population for the provinces in question,
the</p>

<p>4. <i>Karien.</i>&mdash;The Kariens are partially independent;
chiefly pagan; and their language, belonging
to the same class with the Avan, is unlettered.
They are the first of a long list.</p>

<p>Their geographical distribution is remarkable,
like that of the Tha'y. Its direction is north and
south; its dimensions linear, rather than broad;
and it bears nearly the same relation to the water-system
of the Salw&iacute;n that that of the Siamese does
to the river Menam. There are Kariens as far
south as 11&deg; North lat. and there are Kariens as far
north as 25&deg; North lat. Hence we have them in
Maulmein, and in Tenasserim, and in the intermediate
provinces of Ye and Tavoy as well. All
these, like the M&ocirc;n, have been eased by the transfer
from Avan oppression to British rule; though
this says but little. Hence, with one exception,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the other members of their family are decreasing;
the exception being the so-called <i>Red</i> Karien.</p>

<p>This epithet indicates a change in physiognomy;
and, indeed, the physical conformation of the
Burmese tribes requires attention. It is Mongolian
in the way that the Siamese is Mongolian;
but changes have set in. The beard increases;
the hair becomes crisper; and the complexion
darkens. The Kyo,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the isolated occupants of a
single village on the river Koladyng, are so much
darker than their neighbours as to have been
considered half Bengali; and, as a general rule,
the nearer we approach India, the deeper becomes
the complexion. The M&ocirc;n, too, of Pegu,
are very dark. What is this the effect of? Certainly
not of latitude, since we are moving northward.
Of intermarriage? There is no proof of
this. The greater amount of low alluvial soils,
like those of the Ganges and Irawaddi, is, in
my mind, the truer reason. But this is too
general a question to be allowed to delay us.
The Red Kariens are instances of an Asiatic tribe
with an American colour; just as the Red Fulahs
were in Africa. Such are the occupants of the
<i>continent</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Silong.</i>&mdash;In the <i>islands</i> of the Mergui
Archipelago, there is another variety; but whether<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it form a class itself, or belong to any of the previous
ones, is uncertain. Their language is said
to be peculiar;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but of this we have no specimen.
As it is probably that of the oldest inhabitants
of the continent opposite, this is to be
regretted.</p>

<p>They are called <i>Silong</i>, are a sort of sea-gipsy;
and amount to about one thousand. Of all the
creeds of either India or the Indo-Chinese peninsula
theirs is the most primitive; so primitive as
to be characterized by little except its negative
characters. They believe that the land, air, trees,
and waters are inhabited by <i>Nat</i>, or spirits, who
direct the phenomena of Nature. How far they
affect that of man, except indirectly, is unascertained.
"We do not think about that," was the
invariable answer, when any one was questioned
about a future state. Too vague for monotheism,
the Silong creed is also said to be too vague for
idolatry, too vague for sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Kariens, also, believe in <i>Nat</i>, but, as <i>they</i>
believe in their influence on human affairs, they
sacrifice to them accordingly.</p>

<p>Little, then, as we know, respecting these
two families, we know that the common practice
of <i>Nat</i> worship connects them; and this worship
connects many other members of the <i>Burmese</i>
stock. Consequently it helps us to place<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the Silong in that group. It also favours the
notion of the Tenasserim aborigines being Burmese.</p>

<p>It is the delta of the Irawaddi which isolates
the <i>Tenasserim provinces</i>; and the British dependency
from which it separates them is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Arakhan.</i>&mdash;We are prepared for the ethnological
position of the Arakhan populations.
They are <i>Burmese</i>.</p>

<p>We are likewise prepared for a division of
them; there will be the Indianized and the
Pagan&mdash;paganism and political independence going,
to a certain degree, together.</p>

<p>We are prepared for even minuter detail; the
paganism will be Nat-worship; the Indian creed
Buddhism: the alphabet also, where the language
is written, will be Indian also. In Captain
Tower's vocabulary,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> only seven words out of
fifty differ between the Burmese of Arakhan, and
the Burmese of Ava; and some of these are mere
differences of pronunciation.</p>

<p>The language itself is called <i>Rukheng</i> by those
who use it; but the Bengali name is <i>Mug</i>.</p>

<p>This applies to the Indianized part of the population,
the analogues of the Avans and Siamese
of Tenasserim, and of the M&ocirc;n of Maulmein.
What are the Arakhan equivalents to the Karien?</p>

<p><i>The Khyen.</i>&mdash;These inhabit the Yuma mountains<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
between Arakhan and Ava. A full notice of
them is given by Lieutenant Trant, in the sixteenth
volume of the "Asiatic Researches." But
as they are chiefly independent tribes, it is enough
to state that they form the Anglo-Burmese
frontier. It is also added that there are numerous
Khyen slaves in Arakhan.</p>

<p>Farther notice of them is the less important,
because a closely allied population will occur
amongst the hill-tribes of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chittagong.</i>&mdash;Hind&uacute; elements now increase.
Even in Arakhan, Buddhism had ceased to be the
only creed of western origin. There were Mahometans
who spoke a mixed dialect called the
<i>Ruinga</i>;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Brahminical Hind&uacute;s who spoke
another called the <i>Rosawn</i>. In Chittagong, then,
we must look about us for the aborigines; so intrusive
have become the Hind&uacute; elements. Intrusive,
however, they are, and intrusive they will
be for some time to come.</p>

<p>The foot of the hill, and the hill itself, are important
points of difference in Indian ethnology.
On the <i>lower</i> ranges of the mountains on the
north-east of Chittagong are the <i>Khumia</i> (<i>Choomeeas</i>)
or <i>villagers</i>; <i>khum</i> (<i>choom</i>) meaning <i>village</i>.
These are definitely distinguished from
the Hind&uacute;s, by a flat nose, small eye, and broad
round face, in other words by Mongolian characteristics<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the way of physiognomy. But the
<i>Khumia</i> are less perfect samples of their class than
the true mountaineers. These are the <i>Kuki</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;hunters
and warriors, divided into tribes, each
under elective chiefs, themselves subordinate to a
hereditary <i>Raja</i>,&mdash;at least such is the Hind&uacute;
phraseology.</p>

<p>Their creed consists in the belief of <i>Khogein
Pootteeang</i> as a superior, and <i>Sheem Sauk</i> as an
inferior deity; the destruction of numerous enemies
being the best recommendation to their
favour. A wooden figure, of human shape, represents
the latter. The skulls of their enemies
they keep as trophies. In the month of January
there is a solemn festival.</p>

<p>Language and tradition alike tell us that the
Kuki (and most likely the Khumia as well) are
unmodified Mugs. The displacement of their
family has been twofold&mdash;first by Hind&uacute;s, secondly
by Buddhist (or modified) Mugs at the time of the
Burmese conquest. The Kuki population extends
to the wilder parts of the district of <i>Tippera</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sylhet.</i>&mdash;On the southern frontier we have
Kukis; on the eastern Cachari; on the northern
Coosyas (<i>Kasia</i>). Due west of these last lie the
Garo. I imagine that both these last-named
populations are members of the same group&mdash;but
cannot speak confidently. If so, we have departed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
considerably from the more typical Burmese of
Arakhan and Ava. Still we are within the same
great class. The Garo will command a somewhat
full notice.</p>

<p>The Cachars depart still more from the more
typical Burmese; the group to which they most
closely belong being one which will also be enlarged
on.</p>

<p>North of the Kasia we reach the western portion
of the southern frontier of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Assam.</i>&mdash;Here it will be convenient to take the
whole of the valley&mdash;Upper as well as Middle and
Lower Assam&mdash;although parts of the former are
independent rather than British&mdash;and to go round
it; beginning with the Kasia country and the
Jaintia mountains on the south-west. I imagine&mdash;but
am not certain&mdash;that the Kasia and Jaintia
mountaineers are very closely allied.</p>

<p>Next to the Cachars on the southern, or Manipur,
frontier are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Nagas.</i>&mdash;These are in the same class with
the Kuki; <i>i.e.</i>, the wild tribes of Manipur, speaking
a not very altered dialect of the Burmese.</p>

<p><i>The Singpho.</i>&mdash;This people is said to have come
from a locality between their present position and
the north-eastern corner of Assam and the Chinese
frontier. An imperfect Buddhism, and an unappreciated
alphabet of Siamese origin, are the
chief phenomena of their civilization.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Jili.</i>&mdash;These are conterminous with the
Singpho; to whom they are closely allied, in
language, at least; seventy words out of one hundred
agreeing in the two vocabularies.</p>

<p>The <i>Khamti</i> come in now. These have been
mentioned as Tha'y in their most northern localities.
They occupy north-eastern Assam, and
are conterminous with the Singpho. The Khamti
language, with its per-centage of ninety-two words
common to it and the Siamese of Bankok, ten
degrees southwards, has only three out of one
hundred that agree with the Singpho, and ten in
one hundred with the Jili. This shows the remarkable
character of their ethnological distribution,
and, at the same time, suggests the idea of
great displacement.</p>

<p><i>The Mishimi.</i>&mdash;These occupy the north-east
extremity of Assam. With the Mishimi we turn
the corner, and find ourself on the northern or
Tibetan frontier. Here it is the most western
tribes which come first; and these are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Abors and Padam Bor-Abors.</i>&mdash;The first,
like the Kuki, on the mountain-tops; the latter,
like the Khumia, on the lower ranges.</p>

<p><i>The Dufla.</i>&mdash;Mountaineers west of the Abors,
with whom they are conterminous in about 94&deg;
East lon.</p>

<p><i>The Aka.</i>&mdash;Mountaineers west of the Dufla,
with whom they are conterminous in about 92&deg;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
East lon. The Akas bound Lower Assam, the
eastern part of which lies between them and the
Cachari country.</p>

<p>The tribes hitherto mentioned, although sufficiently
numerous, represent the mountaineers of
the Manipur and Tibetan <i>frontiers</i> only. The
native tribes of the valley still stand over. These
are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Muttuck</i> or <i>Moa Mareya</i>, <i>south</i> of the
Brahmaputra, and so far Indianized as to be
Brahminical in religion. Their locality is the
south bank of the Brahmaputra; opposite to that
of&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>The Miri</i>, on the <i>north</i>.&mdash;The Miri are
backed on the north by the Bor-Abors.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Mikir.</i>&mdash;Mr. Robertson looks upon these
as an intrusive people from the Jaintia hills:
their present locality being the district of Nowgong,
where they are mixed up with&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>The Lalong.</i>&mdash;I cannot say whether the
Lalong speak their originally monosyllabic
tongue, or have learnt the Bengali&mdash;a phenomenon
which does much to disguise the true ethnology of
more than one of the forthcoming tribes; one of
which is certainly&mdash;</p>

<p>5. <i>The Dhekra</i>, occupants of Lower Assam and
Kamrup, where they are mixed up with other
sections of the population.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Rabh&aacute;.</i>&mdash;Like the Dhekra, these are<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Hind&uacute;s. Like the Dhekra they speak Bengali.
Hence, like the Dhekra, their true affinities are
disguised. It is, however, pretty generally admitted
by the best authorities that what may be
predicated of the Garo and Bodo&mdash;two families
of which a fuller notice will be given in the sequel&mdash;may
be predicated of the sections in question,
as also of&mdash;</p>

<p>7. <i>The Hajong</i> or <i>Hojai</i>.&mdash;Hind&uacute;s, speaking a
form of the Bengali at the foot of the Garo hills;
and who join the Rabh&aacute;, whose locality is between
Gwahatti and Sylhet, <i>i.e.</i>, at the entrance of the
Assam valley.</p>

<p>The <i>Garo</i> of the Garo hills to the north-east of
Bengal now require notice. A mountaineer of
these parts has much in common with the Coosya;
yet the languages are, <i>perhaps</i>, mutually unintelligible.
In form they are exceedingly alike.</p>

<p>Now, a Garo<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is hardy, stout, and surly-looking,
with a flattened nose, blue or brown eyes, large
mouth, thick lips, round face, and brown complexion.
Their <i>buniahs</i> (<i>booneeahs</i>) or chiefs, are
distinguished by a silken turban. They have a
prejudice against milk; but in the matter of
other sorts of food are omnivorous. Their houses,
called <i>chaungs</i>, are built on piles, from three to
four feet from the ground, from ten to forty in
breadth, and from thirty to one hundred and fifty<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in length. They drink, feast, and dance freely;
and, in their matrimonial forms, much resemble
the Bodo. The youngest daughter inherits. The
widow marries the brother of the deceased; if he
die, the next; if all, the father.</p>

<p>The dead are kept for four days; then burnt.
Then the ashes are buried in a hole on the place
where the fire was. A small thatched building is
next raised over them; which is afterwards railed
in. For a month, or more, a lamp is lit every
night in this building. The clothes of the deceased
hang on poles&mdash;one at each corner of the
railing. When the pile is set fire to, there is
great feasting and drunkenness.</p>

<p>The Garo are no Hind&uacute;s. Neither are they
unmodified pagans. Mahadeva they invoke&mdash;perhaps,
worship. Nevertheless, their creed is
mixed. They worship the sun and the moon,
or rather the sun <i>or</i> the moon; since they ascertain
which is to be invoked by taking a cup of
water and some wheat. The priest then calls on
the name of the sun, and drops corn into the
water. If it sink, the sun is worshipped. If not,
a similar experiment is tried with the name of the
moon. Misfortunes are attributed to supernatural
agency: and averted by sacrifice.</p>

<p>Sometimes they swear on a stone; sometimes
they take a tiger's bone between their teeth and
then tell their tale.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, they have an equivalent to the <i>Lycanthropy</i>
of the older European nations:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among the Garrows a madness exists, which
they call transformation into a tiger, from the
person who is afflicted with this malady walking
about like that animal, shunning all society. It
is said, that, on their being first seized with this
complaint they tear their hair and the rings from
their ears, with such force as to break the lobe.
It is supposed to be occasioned by a medicine
applied to the forehead; but I endeavoured to
procure some of the medicine thus used, without
effect. I imagine it rather to be created by frequent
intoxications, as the malady goes off in the
course of a week or fortnight. During the time
the person is in this state, it is with the utmost
difficulty he is made to eat or drink. I questioned
a man, who had thus been afflicted, as to
the manner of his being seized, and he told me
he only felt a giddiness without any pain, and
that afterwards he did not know what happened
to him."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In a paper of Captain C. S. Reynolds, in the
"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> we
have the notice of a hitherto undescribed superstition;
that of the <i>Korah</i>. A <i>Korah</i> is a dish of
bell-metal, of uncertain manufacture. A small
kind, called Deo Korah, is hung up as a household<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
god and worshipped. Should the monthly
sacrifice of a fowl be neglected, punishment is expected.
If "a person perform his devotion to the
spirit which inhabits the Korah with increasing
fervour and devotion, he is generally rewarded by
seeing the embossed figures gradually expand.
The Garos believe that when the whole household
is wrapped in sleep, the Deo Korahs make expeditions
in search of food, and when they have satisfied
their appetites return to their snug retreats
unobserved."</p>

<p>The Miri are supposed to believe the same of
what are called <i>Deo Guntas</i>, brought from Tibet.</p>

<p>Now what is the classification of all these
tribes? Preliminary to the answer on this point,
there are eleven dialects spoken in the parts
about Manipur&mdash;besides the proper language of
Manipur itself&mdash;to be enumerated. These are
as follows:&mdash;1. Songpu. 2. Kapwi. 3. Koreng.
4. Maram. 5. Champhung. 6. Luhuppa. 7, 8,
9. Northern, Central, and Southern Tangkhul.
10. Khoibu; and 11. Maring. Now these twelve
(the Manipur being included) have been tabulated
by Mr. Brown, in such a way as to show the per-centage
of words that each has with all the others;
and not only these, but nearly all the tongues
which we have had to deal with, are similarly put
in order for being compared. The part of the
table necessary for the present use is as follows:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>The last eleven dialects are not spoken in
any British dependency; and they have only
been mentioned for the sake of explaining the
table.</p>

<p>All belong to one and the same class; a point
upon which I see no room for doubt; although
respecting the <i>value</i> of that class I admit that
some exists.</p>

<p>For this, the term <i>Burmese</i> is as good as any
other&mdash;without professing to be better; yet,
should it seem too precise, there is no objection to
the sufficiently general term of <i>monosyllabic</i> being
substituted for it.</p>

<p>The reader, however, may doubt the fact of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
affinities. This has been done. Long before the
present writer knew of such dialects as the Jili,
Mishimi, Aka, Abor, Singpho, and the like, he had
satisfied himself that the Garo was monosyllabic,
and had so expressed himself in 1844,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> when
Brown's Tables had been published, though not
seen by him. It was with surprise, then, that he
found the author of them writing, that "it would
be difficult to decide from the specimens before
us, whether it is to be ranked with the monosyllabic
or polysyllabic languages. It probably
belongs to the latter."</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Hodgson makes the Garo Tamulian,
<i>i.e.</i>, polysyllabic; a fact which will be noticed
again when the Bodo, Dhimal, and Kocch have
been disposed of.</p>

<p><i>The Kocch</i>, <i>Bodo</i>, and <i>Dhimal</i> is the title of
one of that writer's works&mdash;a model of an ethnological
monograph. This gives us a new class.
The Bodo of Hodgson are the wild tribes that
skirt the Himalayas, from Assam to Sikkim.
West of these, between the river Konki and the
river Dhorla are the Dhimal, a small tribe mixed
with Bodo; and, southwards, in Kocch Behar,
are the Kocch. The two former are so much
described together that a separation is difficult.
This leaves us at liberty to follow the details of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
either one population or of both. The history of
a Bodo from his cradle to his grave is as follows.
The birth is attended with a <i>minimum</i> amount
of ceremonies. Midwives there are none; but
labours are easy. Neither has the priest much to
do with ushering-in the new-comer to the world.
A short period of uncleanness is recognized, but
it is only a short one; the purification consisting
in the acts of bathing and shaving performed by
the parties themselves. Four or five days after
delivery, the mother goes out into the world; and
at that time, the child is named. Any passing
event determines this; as there are no family
names, and no names taken from their mythology.
The account, however, of Mr. Hodgson, in this
respect is somewhat obscure, "A Bhotia chief
arrives at the village, and the child is named
Jinkh&aacute;p; or a hill peasant arrives, and it is
named Gongar, after the titular, or general designation
of the Bhotias."</p>

<p>As long as a mother can suckle a child (or
<i>children</i>) she continues to do so, sometimes for so
long a period as three years, when the last and
last but one may be seen sucking together.</p>

<p>The period of weaning is thus delayed; and,
notwithstanding the current notion as to the
prematurity of marriages in warm climates, that
of wedlock is delayed as well: the male waits till
he is twenty or twenty-five, the female till between<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fifteen and twenty. The parties least concerned
are the bride and bridegroom; the parents
do the courtship. Those of the lady take a payment.
This is called a <i>Jan</i> amongst the Bodo,
and varies from ten to fifteen rupees. With the
Dhimal it is a <i>Gandi</i>, and amounts to a higher
sum, ranging from fifteen to forty-five. Failing
this, service must be done by the youth; and a
wife be earned as Jacob earned Leah and Rachel.
This is the <i>Gabor</i> of the Bodo, and the <i>Gharjya</i>
of the Dhimal.</p>

<p>Such marriages are easily dissolved, <i>i.e.</i>, at
the option of either party. In case, however,
of infidelity on the part of a wife having caused
a divorce, the wedding-money is repaid. Adoption
is common, concubinage rare; each being
on a level with marriage in respect to the <i>status</i>
of the children. Of these, all males inherit alike;
but the rights of the female are limited.</p>

<p>The ceremony itself begins with a procession
on the part of the bridegroom's friends to the
bride's house, two females accompanying them.
Of these, it is the business to put red-lead
and oil on the bride-elect's hair. A feast follows;
after which the husband takes his wife
home. Thus far the Bodo forms agree with
the Dhimal; but they differ in what follows.</p>

<p><i>The Bodo</i> sacrifices a cock and a hen in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
names of the bridegroom and the bride, respectively
to the Sun.</p>

<p><i>The Dhimal</i> propitiate <i>Data</i> and <i>Bedata</i> by
presents of betel-leaf and red-lead.</p>

<p>Both bury their dead, and purify themselves
by ablution in the nearest stream when the
funeral procession is over. The family, however,
of the deceased is considered as unclean
for three days.</p>

<p>A feast with sacrifices attends the purification.
Before sitting down, they repair once
more to the grave, and present the dead with some
of the food from the banquet;&mdash;"take and eat,
heretofore you have eaten and drunk with us;
you can do so no more; you were one of us,
you can be so no longer; we come no more to
you; come you not to us." After this each
member of the party takes from his wrist a
bracelet of thread, and throws it on the grave.</p>

<p>A ceremonial implies a priesthood. Under
this class come the Deoshi, the Dhami, the
Ojha, and the Phantwal.</p>

<p>The first of these is the village, the second
the district, priest.</p>

<p>The Ojha is the village exorcist; and the
Phantwal a subordinate of the Deoshi. The
influence of this clerical body, although probably
higher than Mr. Hodgson places it, is, evidently,
anything but exorbitant.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot find anything in the Bodo and Dhimal
superstitions higher than what was found in Africa.
Nor yet is anything <i>essentially</i> different. Similar
intellectual conditions develop similar creeds, independent
of intercourse; a fact which, the
more we go into the natural history of religions,
the more we shall verify. We read indeed of
<i>oaths</i> and <i>ordeals</i>; but oaths and ordeals are by
no means, what they have too loosely been supposed
to be, appeals to the moral nature of the
Divinity. The <i>dhoom</i> test, in Old Calabar, is an
ordeal. The criminal tests of the Fantis are the
same. Indeed, few, if any tribes, are without
them. What the real ideas are which determine
such and such-like ceremonies is difficult for intellectual
adults to understand. The way towards
their appreciation lies in the phenomena of a
child's mind; the true clue to the psychology of
rude populations.</p>

<p>If we take the Bodo and Dhimal religions in
detail we find ourselves in a familiar field, with
well-known forms of superstition around us.</p>

<p>Diseases are attributed to supernatural agency;
and the medicine-man, exorcist, or Ojha, is more
priest than surgeon.</p>

<p>The <i>feticism</i> of Africa re-appears; at least such
is my inference from the following extract. "<i>Batho</i>
is clearly and indisputably identifiable with
<i>something tangible</i>, <i>viz.</i>, the <i>Sij</i> or <i>Euphorbia</i>;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
though why that useless and even exotic plant
should have been thus selected to type the Godhead,
I have failed to learn."</p>

<p>Euhemerism, or the worship of dead men
deified, is to be found either in its germs or its
rudiments; at any rate, one of their deities bears
the name of Hajo, a known historic personage.
But this may be referable to Hind&uacute; influences
unequivocally traceable in other parts of the
Pantheon.</p>

<p>It is the rites and ceremonies of a country
that give us its religion in the concrete. All
beyond is an abstraction. These, with the Bodo
and Dhimal, are numerous. Invocations, deprecations,
and thanksgivings are all mentioned by
Mr. Hodgson; and they are all attended by offerings
or sacrifices; libations attend the sacrifices,
and feasting follows the libations.</p>

<p>The great festivals of the year are four for
the Bodo, three for the Dhimal.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> In December or January, when the cotton-crop
is ready, the Bodo hold their <i>Shurkhar</i>, the
Dhimal their <i>Harejata</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In February or March, the Bodo hold the
<i>Wagaleno</i>.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> In July or August, the rice comes into ear.
This brings on the Bodo <i>Phulthepno</i>, and the
Dhimal <i>Gavipuja</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>All these are celebrated out of doors, and on
agricultural occasions.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The fourth great festival is held at home;
its time being the month of October; its name
<i>Aihuno</i> in Bodo, and <i>Pochima paka</i> in Dhimal.
Here, in the <i>Aihuno</i> at least, the family assembles,
the priest joins it, and the Sij, or Euphorbia,
represents Batho. This is placed in the
middle of the room, has prayers offered to it,
and a <i>cock</i> as a sacrifice; whilst Mainou's offering
is a <i>hog</i>; Agrang's a <i>he-goat</i>, and so on,
through the whole list of the nine <i>nooni madai</i>,
or deities thus worshipped. As for the symbols
which represent them, besides the Sij, which
stands for Batho, there is a bamboo post about
three feet high, surmounted by a small cup of
rice, denoting Mainou; but the equivalents of
the other seven are somewhat uncertain.</p>

<p>The Wagaleno festival was witnessed by Mr.
Hodgson and Dr. Campbell. The account of it
is something lengthy. I mention it, however,
for the sake of one of its principal actors&mdash;the
D&eacute;&oacute;d&aacute;. This is the <i>possessed</i>, who, "when filled
with the god, answers by inspiration to the question
of the priest as to the prospects of the
coming season. When we first discerned him, he
was sitting on the ground, panting, and rolling
his eyes so significantly that I at once conjectured
his function. Shortly afterwards, the rite<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
still proceeding, the D&eacute;&oacute;d&aacute; got up, entered the
circle, and commenced dancing with the rest,
but more wildly. He held a short staff in his
hand, with which, from time to time, he struck
the bedizened poles, one by one, and lowering it
as he struck. The chief dancer with the odd-shaped
instrument waxed more and more vehement
in his dance; the inspired grew more and
more maniacal; the music more and more rapid;
the incantation more and more solemn and earnest;
till, at last, amid a general lowering of the heads
of the decked bamboo poles, so that they met and
formed a canopy over him, the D&eacute;&oacute;d&aacute; went off
in an affected fit, and the ceremony closed without
any revelation." This self-excited state of
ecstasy is an element of most religions in the
same stage of development; and a low level it
indicates. In Greece, in Africa, and in Northern
Asia, we find it as regularly as we find a coarse
and material creed; and to the coarseness of the
materialism of such a creed it is generally proportionate.</p>

<p>Witches, and the discovery of them, and the
influence of the evil eye are part and parcel of the
Bodo and Dhimal superstitions.</p>

<p><i>Kocch</i> means a population, which possibly
amounts to as much as a million souls, extended
from about 88&deg; to 93&frac12;&deg; East long., and 25&deg; to 27&deg;
North lat., and of which Kocch Behar is the political<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
centre. The term is <i>ethnological</i>&mdash;not political.
It is ethnological, and not political, because,
although originally native, it has since been partially
abandoned. <i>All</i> the inhabitants of the parts
in question <i>once</i> called themselves Kocch; and
Kocch they were called by their neighbours the
Mech. At this time the country was unequivocally
other than Indian; <i>i.e.</i>, in the same category
with that of the Garo and Bodo. Since then,
however, great changes have taken place; so that,
just as Wales is partially Anglicized, the Welsh
language being replaced by the English, the
Kocch&mdash;the native tongue&mdash;is under the process
of being replaced by a Hind&uacute; dialect. Nevertheless,
just as many a Welshman who speaks
nothing but English is still a Welshman, so are
the Kocch, who have changed their languages,
Bodo, Garo, or something closely akin, in ethnological
position.</p>

<p>The extent to which different portions of the
once great Kocch nation have abandoned or retained
their original characteristics is easily measured.</p>

<p>1. Those who have changed most speak a form
of the Bengali, and are imperfect Mahometans;
imperfect, because their creed is strongly tinctured
with Hinduism. Thus the very epithet
which they apply to themselves is Brahminical;
<i>R&aacute;jbansi</i>=<i>Suryabansi</i>=<i>Sun-born</i>. The converted<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Kocch of the Mahometan creed are chiefly of the
lower order of the province of Behar.</p>

<p>2. Those who have changed, but changed less
than the <i>Mahometans</i> of Behar, are either Brahminists
or Buddhists&mdash;speaking the same Bengali
dialect as the last. These are chiefly the higher
classes of the population of Behar. They are
Kocch in the way that the Cornishmen are Welsh.
They consider them <i>R&aacute;jbansi</i> also. Doubtless,
their Hinduism is imperfect; <i>i.e.</i>, tinctured with
the original paganism.</p>

<p>3. The primitive, unconverted, or <i>Pani</i> Kocch,
have either not changed at all, or changed but little.
They retain the original name of Kocch; which
is not endured by the others. They retain their
original tongue, which, according to Buchanan,
has no affinity with any of the Hind&uacute; tongues.
They retain their original customs; and they retain
their original paganism. Lastly, Mr. Hodgson
attests the "entire conformity of the physiognomy
of all&mdash;with that of the other aborigines
around them." He adds that he cannot improve
on Buchanan's account of them, which is as follows:&mdash;"The
primitive or P&aacute;ni Kocch live amid
the woods, frequently changing their abode in
order to cultivate lands enriched by a fallow.
They cultivate entirely with the hoe, and more
carefully than their neighbours who use the
plough, for they weed their crops, which the others<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
do not. As they keep hogs and poultry they
are better fed than the Hind&uacute;s, and as they make
a fermented liquor from rice, their diet is more
strengthening. The clothing of the P&aacute;ni Kocch
is made by the women, and is in general blue,
dyed by themselves with their own indigo, the
borders red, dyed with Morinda. The material is
cotton of their own growth, and they are better
clothed than the mass of the Bengalese. Their
huts are at least as good, nor are they raised
on posts like the houses of the Indo-Chinese,
at least, not generally so. Their only arms are
spears: but they use iron-shod implements of
agriculture, which the Bengalese often do not.
They eat swine, goats, sheep, deer, buffaloes, rhinoceros,
fowls, and ducks&mdash;not beef, nor dogs,
nor cats, nor frogs, nor snakes. They use tobacco
and beer, but reject opium and hemp. They eat
no tame animal without offering it to God (the
Gods), and consider that he who is least restrained
is most exalted, allowing the G&aacute;r&oacute;s to be their
superiors, because the G&aacute;r&oacute;s may eat beef. The
men are so gallant as to have made over all
property to the women, who in return are most
industrious, weaving, spinning, brewing, planting,
sowing; in a word, doing all work not above
their strength. When a woman dies the family
property goes to her daughters, and when a man
marries he lives with his wife's mother, obeying<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
her as his wife. Marriages are usually arranged
by mothers in nonage, but consulting the destined
bride. Grown up women may select a husband
for themselves, and another, if the first die. A
girl's marriage costs the mother ten rupees&mdash;a
boy's five rupees. This sum is expended in a
feast with sacrifice, which completes the ceremony.
Few remain unmarried, or live long. I saw no
grey hairs. Girls, who are frail, can always
marry their lover. Under such rule, polygamy,
concubinage, and adultery are not tolerated. The
last subjects to a ruinous fine, which if not paid,
the offender becomes a slave. No one can marry
out of his own tribe. If he do, he is fined. Sutties
are unknown, and widows always having property
can pick out a new husband at discretion.
The dead are kept two days, during which the
family mourn, and the kindred and friends assemble
and feast, dance and sing. The body is then
burned by a river's side, and each person having
bathed returns to his usual occupation. A funeral
costs ten rupees, as several pigs must be sacrificed
to the manes. This tribe has no letters; but a
sort of priesthood called D&eacute;&oacute;shi, who marry and
work like other people. Their office is not hereditary,
and everybody employs what D&eacute;&oacute;shi he
pleases, but some one always assists at every sacrifice
and gets a share. The Kocch sacrifice to the
sun, moon, and stars, to the gods of rivers, hills<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and woods, and every year, at harvest-home, they
offer fruits and a fowl to deceased parents, though
they believe not in a future state! Their chief
gods are Rishi and his wife J&aacute;g&oacute;. After the
rains the whole tribe make a grand sacrifice to
these gods, and occasionally also, in cases of distress.
There are no images. The gods get the
blood of sacrifices; their votaries, the meat. Disputes
are settled among themselves by juries of
Elders, the women being excluded here, however
despotic at home. If a man incurs a fine, he
cannot pay with purse, he must with person, becoming
a bondman, on food and raiment only,
unless his wife can and will redeem him."</p>

<p>I must now request particular attention on the
part of the reader to the terms which Mr. Hodgson
applies to the physical conformation of these
northern, or sub-Himalayan tribes; and still closer
attention must be given to his nomenclature. He
calls the stock in question <i>Tamulian</i>. This connects
it with the <i>South</i> Indian. He contrasts it
with the <i>Hind&uacute;</i>. By this he means the Brahminical
elements of the Indian populations.</p>

<p>Let us then see what points he considers to be
<i>Tamulian</i>.</p>

<p>1. There is "less height, less symmetry, more
dumpiness and flesh."</p>

<p>2. There is "a somewhat lozenge contour (of
face) caused by the large cheek-bones."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>3. There is "less perpendicularity of features
in the front&mdash;a larger proportion of face to head&mdash;a
broader flatter face&mdash;a shorter wider nose,
often clubbed at the end, and furnished with
round nostrils."</p>

<p>4. There is a smaller eye, "less fully opened,
and less evenly crossing the face by their line of
aperture." In other words, there is the <i>oblique</i>
eye, so much considered in the Chinese physiognomy.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, there are larger ears, thicker lips,
and less beard.</p>

<p>I submit that all these points are Mongolian;
and this is what Mr. Hodgson evidently thinks
also.</p>

<p>The whole class has passed beyond the hunter
state, if ever such existed. It has passed beyond
the pastoral or nomadic state also; if such existed.
It is at present&mdash;and, perhaps, has always been&mdash;an
agricultural state of society. On the other hand&mdash;the
industrial state, the development represented
by towns and commerce, has not been attained.</p>

<p>The whole stock is essentially agricultural.
Likewise, the agriculture is peculiar. We may
explain it by the term <i>erratic</i>. They "never
cultivate the same field beyond the second year,
or remain in the same village beyond the fourth
to sixth year. After the lapse of four or five
years they frequently return to their old fields<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and resume their cultivation, if in the interim the
jungle has grown well, and they have not been
anticipated by others, for there is no pretence of
appropriation other than possessory, and if, therefore,
another party have preceded them, or, if the
slow growth of the jungle give no sufficient promise
of a good stratum of ashes for the land when
cleared by fire, they move on to another site, new
or old. If old, they resume the identical fields
they tilled before, but never the old houses or
site of the old village, that being deemed unlucky.
In general, however, they prefer new land to old,
and having still abundance of unbroken forest
around them, they are in constant movement,
more especially as, should they find a new spot
prove unfertile, they decamp after the first harvest
is got in."</p>

<p><i>Arva in annos mutant et superest ager.</i> This
passage is explained by their customs.</p>

<p>In respect to their social constitution, they
dwell in small communities of from ten to forty
houses; each of which community is under a
<i>gr&agrave;</i> or head. This is Hind&uacute;&mdash;except that as the
Hind&uacute; villages are both larger and more permanent,
the functionaries, in addition to the <i>headman</i>,
are more numerous. This is noted, because
the difference in the two sorts of village government
seems to be one of <i>degree</i> rather than
<i>kind</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>And now comes more in the way of classification.
The Bodo are Kachars, or the Kachars are
Bodo. Their languages are the same, so are
their gods, so is their name; since Kachar is a
Hind&uacute;, and no native term&mdash;the native name
(<i>i.e.</i>, of the Kachars) being <i>Bodo</i>. On the other
hand, the <i>Hind&uacute;</i> name of the Bodo is Mech.
Whoever looks to a map will find that the outline
of the Bodo area is very deeply indented; implying
either a great original irregularity of area, or
great subsequent displacement.</p>

<p>Now follow the Garo. One fourth&mdash;fifteen out
of sixty&mdash;of the words of Mr. Brown's Garo
vocabulary is Bodo. The inference? That the
Bodo and Garo are in the same category. What
is this? Mr. Hodgson makes both Tamulian or
Indian. In my own mind both are Burmese.
But be this as it may, one fact is certain; <i>viz.</i>,
that a transition between the tongues of the Indian
and the tongues of the Indo-Chinese peninsula
exists, and that the lines of demarcation which
divide them are less broad and trenchant than is
generally supposed.</p>

<p>The Dhimal bring us to Sikkim. The dominant
nation of Sikkim are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Lepchas.</i>&mdash;Their language also is monosyllabic;
but it is Tibetan rather than Burmese.
They are a Sikkim rather than a British Indian
population.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>When we have passed the rajahship of Sikkim,
we reach that of Nep&acirc;l. This, again, is independent.
Such being the case, the line of frontier
between the Hind&uacute; populations and the populations
of the Bodo and Garo character lies beyond
the pale of the British dependencies.</p>

<p>But in proceeding westward, we pass Nep&acirc;l,
and reach Kumaon.</p>

<p>This is British, and, as it extends as far north
as the Himalayas, it may contain monosyllabic
languages, and tribes speaking them. It may
present also instances of intermixture like those
which we have already found in Behar&mdash;the line
of demarcation being equally difficult and undefined.
Difficult and undefined it really is&mdash;because,
although it is an easy matter to take a
portion of the Sirmor, Gurhwal, or Kumaon
population, and say, "this is Hind&uacute; because both
language and creed make it so," it is by no means
so easy to prove that the blood, pedigree, or descent
is Hind&uacute; also. To repeat an illustration
already in use&mdash;many such populations may be
Hind&uacute; only as the Cornishmen are English.</p>

<p>Now the populations of the Tibetan stock to
the west of Nep&acirc;l, so little known in detail, must
be illustrated by means of our knowledge of the
tribes of Nep&acirc;l and Tibet most closely related to
them&mdash;by those of Nep&acirc;l on the east, and those
of Tibet on the north.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>For neither of these areas are there any very
minute <i>data</i>. For the aborigines of <i>eastern</i> and
<i>central</i> Nep&acirc;l, we have plenty of information.
They are tribes speaking monosyllabic languages,
and tribes in different degrees of intercourse
with the Hind&uacute;s; being by name&mdash;1. The Magars.
2. The Gurungs. 3. The Jariyas. 4. The
Newars. 5. The Murmis. 6. The Kirata. 7. The
Limbu; and 8. The Lepchas, common to the
eastern boundary of Nep&acirc;l, to the western part
of Butan, and to Sikkim. This, however, will
not bring us far west enough for the Kumaon
frontier; indeed, for the forests of Nep&acirc;l <i>west</i> of
the Great Valley, we have the notice of one
family only&mdash;the Chepang. For this, as for so
much more, we are indebted to Mr. Hodgson. It
falls into three tribes; the Chepang proper, the
Kusunda, and the Haju. Its language (known
to us by a vocabulary) is monosyllabic; its
physical conformation, that of the unmodified
Indian.</p>

<p>So much for analogy. In the way of direct
information we simply know that the Pariahs, or
outcasts, of Kumaon<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> are called <i>Doms</i>. These
have darker skins and curlier hair than the
Hind&uacute;s. Are these enslaved and partially amalgamated<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
aborigines? Probably. Nay more; in
the eastern part of the province, amidst the
forests at the foot of the Himalayas, a community
of about twenty families, pertinaciously adheres
to the customs of their ancestors, resembles the
<i>Doms</i> in looks, and is called <i>Rawat</i> or <i>Raji</i>.
Though I have seen no specimen of their language,
I have little doubt as to the <i>Rawat</i> of
Kumaon being the equivalents to the Chepang of
Nep&acirc;l.</p>

<p>From Konawur we have three monosyllabic
vocabularies, the Sumchu, the Theburskud, and
the Milchan; but the exact amount to which the
Tibetan and the Hind&uacute; populations indent each
other along the western Himalayas is more than I
can give.</p>

<p>Here end the monosyllabic tongues spoken in
British India. But they fringe the Himalayas
throughout, and occur in the country of Gholab
Singh, as well as in the independent rajahships
between the Sutlege and Cashmeer. My latest
researches have carried them even further westward
than Little Tibet; as far as the Kohistan,
or mountain country, of Cabul&mdash;the Der, Lughmani,
Tirhai, and other languages, known, wholly
or chiefly, through the vocabularies of Lieutenant
Leach, being essentially monosyllabic in structure,
and definitely connected with the tongues of
Tibet, and Nep&acirc;l in respect to their vocables.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is episodical to the subject&mdash;a subject
still requiring the notice of a very important
phenomenon.</p>

<p><i>Polyandria</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> is a term in ethnology, even as
it is in botany. Its meaning, however, is different.
Etymologically, it denotes a form of <i>polygamy</i>.
<i>Polygamy</i>, however, being restricted to
that particular form of marriage which consists in
a multiplicity of <i>wives</i>, <i>polyandria</i> expresses the
reverse, <i>viz.</i>, the plurality of <i>husbands</i>.</p>

<p>At the first glance, the word <i>polyandria</i> looks
like a learned name for a common thing; and
suggests the inquiry as to how it differs from
simple promiscuity of intercourse; or, at least,
how far the Tibetan wife differs from the fair frail
one who was always constant to the 85th regiment.
The answer is not easy. Still it is certain
that some difference exists&mdash;if not in form, at
least, in its effects. One of these, in certain
countries where <i>polyandria</i> prevails, is the law of
succession to property. This follows the female
line, rather than the male.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;the marriage of the widow with the
surviving brother of her husband, is polyandria
under another form.</p>

<p>What the exact polyandria of Tibet is, is uncertain.
I am not prepared to deny its existence
even in so extreme a form as that of <i>one woman<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
being married to several husbands, all alive at once</i>.
Still, I think it more likely that either the circle
of community was limited to certain degrees of
relationships, or else that the multiplied husbands
were successive, rather than simultaneous. Still,
the facts of the Tibetan <i>polyandria</i> require further
investigation.</p>

<p>One thing, only, is certain&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, that as an
ethnological criterion the practice is of no great
value. Capable, as it has been shown to be, of
modification in form, it is anything but limited to
either Tibet, or the families allied to the Tibetan.
It occurs in many parts of the world. It is a
Malabar practice; where it is, probably, as truly
Tibetan as in Tibet itself. But it is also Jewish,
African, Siberian, and North American; so that
nothing would more mislead us in the classification
of the varieties of man than to mistake it for
a phenomenon <i>per se</i>, and allow it to separate
allied, or to connect distinct populations.</p>

<p><i>Necdum finitus Orestes.</i>&mdash;There are several populations
which, on fair grounds, have been believed
to be in the same category with the Dhekra,
<i>i.e.</i>, which are Hind&uacute; in language and creed,
though monosyllabic in blood. The Kudi, Batar,
Kebrat, Pallah, Gangai, Maraha, Dhanak, Kichak,
and Tharu, are oftener alluded to than described&mdash;though,
doubtless, a better-informed investigator
in such special matters than the present<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
writer could find several definite details concerning
them. They seem chiefly referable to Behar
and north-eastern Bengal. The <i>Dhungers</i>&mdash;in
the same class&mdash;the husbandmen of South Behar,
bring us down to the vicinity of the population
next to be noticed; a population which is generally
considered with reference to the nations,
tribes, and families of <i>Southern</i> rather than <i>Northern</i>
India.</p>

<p>The name of this family has already been mentioned.
It is <i>Tamulian</i>; and the <i>Tamulian</i> physiognomy
has been described. It has been seen
to extend as far north as the Himalayas. If so,
the nations already enumerated have been Tamulian;
and no new class is now approaching. This
may or may not be the case. Another change,
however, is more undeniable. This is that of
language. It is no longer referable to the
Chinese type; since separate monosyllables have,
more or less perfectly, become <i>agglutinated</i> into
inflected forms, and the speech is as <i>poly</i>-syllabic
as the other tongues of the world in general.
As we approach the south this abandonment
of the monosyllabic character increases, and from
the <i>Tamul</i> language spoken between Pulicat and
Cape Comorin, the term <i>Tamulian</i>&mdash;applicable in
a general ethnological sense&mdash;is derived. <i>Agglutinated</i>
(or <i>agglutinate</i>) is also a technical term.
It means languages in the second stage of their<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
development; when words originally separate,
such as adverbs of time, prepositions, and personal
pronouns, have become permanently connected
with the root, so as to form tenses, cases, and
persons&mdash;the union of the two parts of an inflected
word being still sufficiently recent and
imperfect to leave their original separation and
independence visible and manifest. When the
incorporation or amalgamation, has become more
complete; so complete, as in most cases to have
obliterated all vestiges of an original independence;
the <i>agglutinate</i> character has departed, the
second stage of development has been passed,
and the language is in the same class with
those of Greece, Rome, and Germany, rather than
in that of the tongues in question, and of many
others.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the <i>Tamulian</i> family,
meaning thereby a branch of the great Mongolian
stock, speaking, <i>either now or formerly</i>, a language
more or less allied to the Tamul of the
Dekhan.</p>

<p>The first members of the class, as we proceed
southwards from Behar, are certain hill-tribes
of the Rajmahali Mountains&mdash;the Rajmahali
mountaineers. Their Mongolian physiognomy is
unequivocal;&mdash;a Mongolian physiognomy but
conjoined with a dark skin. They have "broad
faces, small eyes, and flattish or rather turned-up<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
noses. Their lips are thicker than those of the
inhabitants of the plain."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The flattened nose reminded the writer of the
Negro, and the general character of the features
of the Chinese or Malay; though it is added that
the resemblance is in a great degree lost on closer
inspection. At the same time it has been sufficiently
recognized to have originated the hypothesis
of a descent from one of those nations as
a means of accounting for it.</p>

<p>With a slight tincture of Brahminic Hinduism,
the Rajmahali mountaineers are Pagans. <i>Bedo</i> is
one of their gods; doubtless the <i>Potteang</i> of the
Kuki, and the <i>Batho</i> of the Bodo. <i>Gosaik</i>, too,
is either the name of a god, or a holy epithet;
this, also, being a mythological term current
amongst many other tribes of India. Other elements
in their imperfectly-known mythology
deserve notice. Their priesthood contains both
<i>Demauns</i> and <i>Dewassis</i>; the latter form being the
Bodo <i>Deoshi</i>. As the names are alike, so are
the functions. The <i>Dewassi</i> is an oracular seer.
When he vouchsafes to give answers, his inspiration
takes the form of frenzy&mdash;but he neither
hurts nor speaks to any one. He makes signs for
a cock, and for a hen's egg as well. The cock's
head he wrenches off, and sucks the bleeding
neck. The egg he eats. After this he seeks the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
solitude of the wood or stream; and is fed by the
deity. Sometimes he has ridden a snake; sometimes
put his hands in the mouth of a tiger with
impunity. Trees too large to move, or too thorny
to touch, he places on the roofs of houses. He
sees Bedo Gosaik in visions; and, in the sacrifices
therein enjoined, red paint, rice, and pigeons
make a part. From the touch of women he
abstains; so he does from the taste of flesh.
Either would make his prophecies false.</p>

<p>There are also certain sacrifices that the <i>Maungy</i>
(chief?) of each village makes, and in which threads
of red silk play a part.</p>

<p>One of their gods&mdash;an elemental one&mdash;is the
god of rain, and the dangers of a drought are
averted by praying to him. A ceremony called
the <i>Satane</i> determines the chief who takes the
office of invoker.</p>

<p>A black stone, called <i>Ruxy</i>, is much of the
same sort of fetish with these mountaineers as
the Sij with the Bodo. The name, too, Ruxy
<i>Nad</i>, suggests the Nat worship of the Silong,
Kariens, and others.</p>

<p>The northern half of the Tamulian families
are, like the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Bretons
of France, members of the same ethnological
group, but not in geographical contact with each
other. Or, rather, they are, like the Celtic population
of Wales and the Scottish Highlands, cut<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
off from one another by a vast tract of intervening
Anglo-Saxons. Yet the time was when all was
Celtic, from Cape Wrath to the Land's End;
and when the original population extended, in
its full integrity, over York and Nottingham,
as well as over Merioneth and Argyleshire. And
so it is with the populations in question. They
stand apart from each other, like islands in an
ocean; the intervening spaces being filled up by
Hind&uacute;s. At the same time the isolation has
been much overvalued, and, I imagine that when
greater attention shall have been bestowed upon
this important subject, connecting links which
have hitherto been unnoticed will be detected.</p>

<p>The next locality where we find a population
akin to the Rajmahali mountaineers, is the mountain
system of Orissa. These are called by the
Hind&uacute;s <i>K&oacute;ls</i> (<i>Coolies</i>), <i>Khonds</i> and <i>S&uacute;rs</i>. Such,
however, are no native designations&mdash;no more
than the classical term <i>Barbarian</i>, or the English
word <i>Tartar</i>. The people themselves have no
collective name; but, being divided into tribes,
have a separate one for each.</p>

<p>I say that this branch of Tamulians is isolated,
because I am not able to show its continuity; the
range of hill-country which gives rise to the
rivers between the Ganges and Mahanuddy being
but imperfectly known.</p>

<p>In Orissa, the most northern of the hill-tribes<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
are the K&oacute;l of Cuttack. South of these come the
Khonds best studied in the neighbourhood of
Goomsoor. The following is a list of their gods,
and as <i>n</i> seems to stand for <i>d</i>, <i>Pennu</i> is but
another name for <i>Bedo</i>, and <i>Gossa Pennu</i> for
<i>Bedo Gosaik</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>1. Bera <i>Pennu</i>, or the earth god.</p>

<p>2. Bella <i>Pennu</i>, the sun god, and Danzu <i>Pennu</i>, the moon god.</p>

<p>3. Sandhi <i>Pennu</i>, the god of limits.</p>

<p>4. Loha <i>Pennu</i>, the iron god, or god of arms.</p>

<p>5. Jugah <i>Pennu</i>, the god of small-pox.</p>

<p>6. Madzu <i>Pennu</i>, or the village deity, the universal <i>genius loci</i>.</p>

<p>7. Soro <i>Pennu</i>, the hill god.</p>

<p>8. Jori <i>Pennu</i>, the god of streams.</p>

<p>9. Gossa <i>Pennu</i>, the forest god.</p>

<p>10. Munda <i>Pennu</i>, the tank god.</p>

<p>11. Sugu <i>Pennu</i>, or Sidruja <i>Pennu</i>, the god of fountains.</p>

<p>12. Pidzu <i>Pennu</i>, the god of rain.</p>

<p>13. Pilamu <i>Pennu</i>, the god of hunting.</p>

<p>14. The god of births.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></div>

<p>The most southern of the Orissa hill-tribes are
the <i>S&uacute;r</i>; connected by language with the preceding
tribes; as they were with each other and
the Rajmahali mountaineers.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>These stand in remarkable contrast with the
rest of the population of Orissa; whose language
is the Udiya, a tongue which, according to many,
belongs to a wholly different class, or, at least,
to a different division of the present.</p>

<p>South of Chicacole, however, the Tamul tongues
are spoken continuously. I cannot say where the
southern limits of the S&uacute;r population come in
contact with the northern ones of the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chenchwars</i>&mdash;who occupy the same range of
mountains, in the parts between the rivers Kistna
and Pennar, and, probably, extending as far
south as the neighbourhood of Madras. Their language
is the Telugu, the language of the parts
around, and of Tamul origin.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The contrast between
the Chenchwars of the hills, and the Telingas
of the lower country lies in their mythologies;
the former retaining much of the original creed of
their country, the latter being Brahminists.</p>

<p>Below Madras, the mountain range changes its
direction, and the next locality under notice is
the Neilgherry hills.</p>

<p>The families here are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Cohatars</i>&mdash;so little Indianized as to eat
of the flesh of the cow, amounting to about two
thousand in number, and occupants of the highest
part of the range.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>The Tudas.</i>&mdash;An interesting monograph by
Captain Harkness has drawn unusual attention to
these mountaineers, the chief points of importance
being the comparative absence of all elements of
Brahminism, and the occurrence in their physiognomy
of the most favourable points of Hind&uacute;
beauty&mdash;regular and delicate features, oval face,
and a clear brunette skin. Free from the other
religious and social characteristics of Hinduism as
the Tudas may be, they still admit a sort of caste;
<i>e.g.</i>, whilst the <i>Peiki</i>, or <i>Toralli</i>, may perform any
function, the <i>Kuta</i>, or <i>Tardas</i>, are limited.
Neither did they always intermarry, though they
do now; their offspring being called <i>Mookh</i>, or
<i>descendants</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Curumbas</i>, called by the Tudas <i>Curbs</i>,
inhabit a lower level than the preceding populations,
but a higher one than&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>The Erulars</i> at the foot of the hills; falling
into two divisions&mdash;<i>a</i>, the <i>Urali</i> (a name to be
noticed), and <i>b</i>, the <i>Curutali</i>.</p>

<p>Between the Neilgherries and Cape Comorin,
the hill-tribes are worth enumerating, if only for
the sake of showing their complexity. According
to Lieutenant Conner in the "Madras Journal,"
they are&mdash;1, Cowders; 2, Vaishvans; 3, M&uacute;davenmars;
4, Arreamars, or Vailamers; 5, Ural-Uays.
Besides these, there is a population of
predial slaves, divided and subdivided.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<ul><li>1. Vaituvan, Konaken.</li>

<li>2. Polayers&mdash;

<ul><li><i>a.</i> Vulluva.</li>

<li><i>b.</i> Kunnaka.</li>

<li><i>c.</i> Morny Pulayer.</li></ul></li>

<li>3. Pariahs.</li>

<li>4. Vaidurs.</li>

<li>5. Ulanders and Naiadi.</li></ul>

<p>To return to the Neilgherries, and follow the
western Ghauts upwards, a population more
numerous than any hitherto mentioned is that
of the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Buddugurs</i>, called also <i>Marv&eacute;s</i>. This name
takes so many forms that <i>Berdar</i> may be one of
them. One division of Buddugurs is called
<i>Lingait</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot follow the Ghauts consecutively; however,
when we reach the southern portion of the
Mahratta country, we find in the rajahship of
Satarah, two predatory tribes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Berdars</i>, supposed to be closely allied to
Ramusi. The&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ramusi</i> themselves connected by tradition and
creed, with the <i>Lingait</i> Buddugurs. But not by
language; or at any rate not wholly so. The
Ramusi dialect is a mixture of Tulava and
Marathi&mdash;the former being undoubted Tamul,
but the latter in the same category with the
Udiya.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The continuous Tamul languages are now left
to the south of us, and the hill-tribes next in
order, will have unlearnt their native tongues,
and be found speaking the Hind&uacute; dialects of the
countries around them. Hence, the evidence of
their Tamulian descent will be less conclusive.</p>

<p><i>Warali of the Konkan.</i>&mdash;Mountaineers of the
northern Konkan. We have seen this name
twice already, and we shall see it again. The
evidence of their Tamulian extraction is imperfect.
Their language is Marathi and their creed
an imperfect Brahminism. Their mountaineer
habits separate them from&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Katodi</i>&mdash;outcasts, who take their name
from preparing the <i>kat</i>, or <i>cat-echu</i>, and who hang
about the villages of the <i>plains</i>.</p>

<p><i>The K&uacute;li.</i>&mdash;From Poonah to Gujerat, the occupants
of the range of mountains parallel to the
coast are called <i>K&uacute;li</i> (<i>Coolies</i>), the same in the
eyes of the Hind&uacute;s of the western coast, as the <i>K&oacute;l</i>
were in those of the Bengalese and Orissans; and
similarly named. Their language is generally (perhaps
always) that of the country around them, <i>viz.</i>,
Marathi amongst the Mahrattas, and Gujerathi
in Gujerat. However, difference of habits
and creed sufficiently separate them from the
Hind&uacute;s.</p>

<p><i>The Bhils.</i>&mdash;These are generally associated with
the K&uacute;lis; from whom they chiefly differ geographically,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
belonging, as they do to the transverse
ranges&mdash;the Satpura and Vindhia mountains&mdash;rather
than to the main line of the Ghauts with
its due north-and-south direction, and with its
parallelism to the coast.</p>

<p><i>The Paurias.</i>&mdash;Hill-tribes in Candeish, belonging
to the Satpura range, and conterminous with
the Bhil tribes, and with&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Wurali of the Satpura range.</i>&mdash;The Wurali
re-appear for the fourth time. In the parts in
question they are in contact with the Bhils and
Paurias; from whom they keep themselves distinct;
and from whom they differ in dialect.
Still their language is Marathi. Pre-eminent as
they are for their Paganism, their country contains
ruins of brick buildings, and considerable
excavations.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>These three are the hill-tribes of the water-shed
of the rivers Tapti and Nerbudda. The water-system
of the south-western feeders of the Ganges
is more complex. Along the mountains between
Candeish and Jeypur come&mdash;</p>

<p>Certain <i>Bhil</i> tribes.</p>

<p><i>The Mewars</i>&mdash;under the Grasya chiefs of Joora,
Meerpoor, Oguna, and Panurwa. The political
relations of these tribes&mdash;in some cases of an undetermined
nature&mdash;are with the Rajp&uacute;t governments;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in other words, we are now amongst the
aborigines of Rajasthan.</p>

<p><i>The Minas.</i>&mdash;These, like the Mewars, are in
geographical contact with certain Bhil tribes; in
political contact with the Rajp&uacute;ts&mdash;the Mewars
with those of Udip&uacute;r; the Minas with those of
Ajmer, Jeypur, and Kota.</p>

<p><i>The Moghis.</i>&mdash;At present, a free company rather
than a population; although the representatives
of what was once one&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the aborigines of
Jodpure. So little Brahminists are they that they
eat of the flesh of the jackal and the cow, and
indulge freely in fermented drinks.</p>

<p>The hills that separate Malwah from the Haroti
country, and from the south-eastern boundary of
the valley of the River Chumbul are occupied
by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Saireas.</i>&mdash;This is a name which has occurred
before and elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and is almost certainly,
anything but native. Tribes, under this
name, extend into Bundelcund.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><i>The Goands.</i>&mdash;The central parts between Candeish
and Orissa, the head-waters of the Nerbudda
and Tapti on the west, and of the Godavery
on the east, still require notice. Here the hill
population is at its <i>maximum</i>, both in point of
numbers and characteristics; and the <i>Khond</i> forms<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of the Tamul re-appear under the name <i>Goand</i>.
Of these we have specimens from&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The Gawhilghur mountains near Ellichpoor.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Chupprah.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Mundala in <i>Gundwana</i>, or the <i>Goand</i> country.</p>

<p>Such are the chief hill-populations; which,
although they belong to Tamulian stock, differ as
to the extent to which they carry outward and
visible signs of their origin. Some, like the Rajmahali,
are merely separated geographically; and,
perhaps, not even that. Others, like the Khonds
of Orissa, are contrasted with the Tamuls of the
south, by their inferior and social condition, and
their non-Brahminical creeds. The Minas and
Bhils differ in language; whilst the Ramusis
and Berdars, probably, exhibit transitional forms
of speech. The Tudas and Chenchwars surrounded
by Telingas and Tamuls, as the Khonds
and Goands are by Udiyas and Mahrattas, are
merely the population of the parts around them
with a primitive polity and religion.</p>

<p>The <i>lettered</i> languages of the Dekhan, where
the Tamul character is unequivocal, but where the
civilizational influences have chiefly been Hind&uacute;,
are spoken in continuity from Chicacole, east, and
the parts about Goa, west, to Cape Comorin, <i>i.e.</i>,
in the Madras Presidency, and in the countries of
Mysore, Travancore, and the coasts of Malabar<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and Coromandel. Of these, the most northern&mdash;beginning
on the eastern coast&mdash;is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Telinga or Telugu.</i>&mdash;Spoken from the
parts about Chicacole to Pulicat, where it is succeeded
by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Tamul Proper.</i>&mdash;The language of the Coromandel
coast and the parts of the interior as
far as Coimbatore. Each of these tongues has a
double form, one for literature, and one for
common use; the former being called the High,
the latter the Low, Tamul or Telugu, as the case
may be, and the creed which it embodies being
either Brahminism, or some modification of it.</p>

<p>In Travancore and on the Malabar coast the
language is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Malayalma</i> or <i>Malayalam</i>&mdash;and in the
greater part of Mysore&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Kanara</i>&mdash;which, like the Tamul and Telinga,
is both High and Low&mdash;literary or
vulgar.</p>

<p>Amongst these four well-known forms of the
South Tamulian tongue, may be distributed
several dialects and sub-dialects. Such as the
Tulava for the parts between Goa and Mangalore,
and the Coorgi of the Rajahship of Coorg, not to
mention the several varieties in the language of
the hill-tribes.</p>

<p>Now all the populations of the present chapter
agree in this particular&mdash;their language is generally<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
admitted to be Tamulian at the present moment,
or if not, to have been so at some earlier period.
With the languages next under notice, the original
Tamulian character is not so admitted&mdash;indeed,
it is so far denied as to make the affirmation
of it partake of the nature of paradox.</p>

<p>The distinction then is raised on the existence
of the doubt in question, or rather on the differences
that such a doubt implies. Hence the
division of the languages of India into the Hind&uacute;
and the Tamulian is practical rather than scientific&mdash;the
<i>Hind&uacute;</i> meaning those for which a <i>Sanskrit</i>,
rather than a <i>Tamul</i> affinity is claimed.</p>

<p><i>Sanskrit</i> is the name of a language; a name
upon which nine-tenths of the controversial points
in Indian ethnology and in Indian history turn.</p>

<p>The language called <i>Sanskrit</i> has a peculiar
alphabet. It has long been written, and embodies
an important literature. It has been well studied;
and its ethnological affinities are understood.
They are at least as remarkable as any other of
its characters.</p>

<p>Like most other tongues, it falls into dialects;
just like the ancient Greek. Like the Doric,
&AElig;olic, and Ionic, these dialects were spoken over
distant countries, and cultivated at different periods.
Like them, too, each is characterized by
its peculiar literature.</p>

<p>The Sanskrit itself, in its oldest form, is the
<i>Vedaic</i> dialect of the religious hymns called
<i>Vedas</i>&mdash;of great, but of exaggerated, antiquity.</p>

<p>Another form of equal antiquity is the language<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the Persepolitan and other arrow-headed
inscriptions. These are of a known antiquity,
and range from the time of Cambyses to that of
Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>By <i>old</i> is meant <i>old in structure</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, betraying
by its archaic forms, an early stage of development.
It is by no means <i>old</i> in chronology. In
the way of chronology, the English of Shakespeare
is older than the German of Goethe; yet the
German of Goethe is the older tongue, because it
retains more old inflections.</p>

<p>The third form is called <i>Pali</i>. In this is
written the oldest Indian inscription; one containing
the name of Antiochus, one of Alexander's
successors. It is also the dialect of the
chief Buddhist works.</p>

<p>A fourth form is the <i>Bactrian</i>. This occurs in
the coins of Macedonian and other Indianized
kings of Bactria, and is best studied in the
"Ariana Antiqua," of Wilson.</p>

<p>A fifth is the <i>Zend</i> of the Zendavesta, the
Scriptures of the followers of Zoroaster.</p>

<p>Others are called <i>Pracrit</i>. Some of the Sanskrit
works are dramatic. In the modern comedies
of Italy we find certain characters speaking
the provincial dialects of Naples, Bologna, and
other districts. The same took place here. In
the Sanskrit plays we find deflexions from the
standard language, put into the mouths of some of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the subordinate characters. It is believed that these
Pracrits represented certain local dialects, as opposed
to the purer and more classical Sanskrit.</p>

<p>Every spoken dialect of Hindostan has a per-centage
of Sanskrit words in it; just as every
dialect of England has an amount of Anglo-Norman.
What does this prove? That depends upon
the per-centage; and this differs in different
languages. In a general way it may be stated
that, amongst the tongues already enumerated, it
is smallest in the isolated Tamulian tongues;
larger in the Tamul of the Dekhan; and largest
in the tongues about to be enumerated; these
being the chief languages of modern Hindostan.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Marathi</i> of the Mahrattas. Here the
Sanskrit words amount to four-fifths in the Marathi
dictionaries.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Udiya</i>, of Cuttack and Orissa, with a
per-centage of Sanskrit greater than that of the
Marathi, but less than that of&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The <i>Bengali</i>. Here it is at its <i>maximum</i>,
and amounts to nine-tenths.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Hind&uacute;</i>, of Oude, and the parts between
Bengal and the Punj&acirc;b, falling into the subordinate
dialects of the Rajp&uacute;t country.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Gujerathi</i> of Gujerat.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Scindian</i> of Scinde.</p>

<p>7. The <i>Multani</i> of M&uacute;ltan; probably a dialect
of either the Gujerathi or<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>8. The <i>Punjabi</i> of the Punj&acirc;b.</p>

<p>By going into minor differences this list might
be enlarged.</p>

<p>None of the previous languages were mentioned
in the last chapter; in fact, they were those
different Hind&uacute; tongues which were contrasted
with the Tamulian, and which, in the northern
part of the Peninsula had effected those displacements
which separated, or were supposed to
separate, the Rajmahali, K&oacute;l, and Khond
dialects from each other. They formed the <i>sea</i> of
speech, in which those tongues were <i>islands</i>.</p>

<p>Now what is the inference from these per-centages?
from such a one as the Bengali, of
ninety out of one hundred? What do they prove
as to the character of the language in which they
occur? Do they make the Sanskrit the basis of the
tongue, just as the Anglo-Saxon is of the English,
or do they merely show it as a superadded foreign
element, like the Norman&mdash;like that in kind, but
far greater in degree? The answer to this will
give us the philological position of the North-Indian
tongues. It will make the Bengali either
Tamul, with an unprecedented amount of foreign
vocables, or Sanskrit, with a few words of the
older native tongue retained.</p>

<p>If the question were settled by a reference to
authorities, the answer would be that the Bengali
was essentially Sanskrit.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be the same if we took only the <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> view of the matter.</p>

<p>Yet the answer is traversed by two facts.</p>

<p>1. In making the per-centage of Sanskrit words
it has been assumed that, whenever the modern
and ancient tongues have any words in common,
the former has always taken them from the latter,&mdash;an
undue assumption, since the Sanskrit may
easily have adopted native words.</p>

<p>2. The grammatical inflections are so far from
being as Sanskritic as the vocables, that they are
either non-existent altogether, unequivocally Tamul,
or else <i>controverted</i> Sanskrit.</p>

<p>Here I pause,&mdash;giving, at present, no opinion
upon the merits of the two views. The reader
has seen the complications of the case; and is
prepared for hearing that, though most of the
highest authorities consider the languages of
northern India to be related to the Sanskrit, just
as the English is to the Anglo-Saxon, and the
Italian to the Latin; others deny such a connexion,
affirming that as the real relations of the
Sanskrit are those of the Norman-French to our
own tongue, and of the Arabic to the Spanish,
there is no such thing throughout the whole length
and breadth of Hindostan as a dialect descended
from the Sanskrit, or a spot whereon that famous
tongue can be shown to have existed as a spoken
and indigenous language.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>But, perhaps, we may find in Persia what we lack
in India; and as the modern Persian is descended
from the Zend, and as the Zend is a sister to the
Sanskrit, Persia may, perhaps, supply such a locality.
The same doubts apply here.</p>

<p>Such are the doubts that apply to an important
question in Asiatic ethnology. I am not, at
present, going beyond the simple fact of their
existence. Rightly or wrongly, there is an opinion
that the Sanskrit never was indigenous to any part
of India, not even the most north-western; and
there is an extension of this opinion which&mdash;rightly
or wrongly&mdash;similarly excludes it from
Persia. So much doubt should be relieved by
the exhibition of some universally admitted fact
as a set-off.</p>

<p>Such a contrast shall be supplied, in the shape
of a comment on the following tables.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It is one

<p>The inference from the vast series of philological
facts, of which the following is a specimen, has,
generally&mdash;perhaps <i>universally</i>&mdash;been as follows,
<i>viz.</i>, that the Lithuanic, Slavonic, and the allied
languages of Germany, Italy, and Greece&mdash;numerous,
widely-spread, and unequivocally European&mdash;are
<i>Asiatic</i> in origin; the Sanskrit being
first referred to Asia, and then assumed to represent
the languages of that Asiatic locality. I
merely express my dissent from this inference;
adding my belief that the relations of the Sanskrit
to the Hind&uacute; tongues are those of the Anglo-Norman
to the English, and that its relation to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
those of the south-eastern Slavonic area, is that
of the Greek of Bactria, to the Greek of Macedon&mdash;greater,
much greater in degree, but the same
in kind.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The Brahminic creed of Hindostan is the next
great characteristic. Brahminism may be viewed
in two ways. We may either take it in its later
forms, and trace its history backwards, or begin
with it in its simplest and most unmodified stage,
and notice the changes that have affected it as
they occur. At the present its principles are to
be found in the holy book called <i>Puranas</i>; the
Brahminism of the <i>Puranas</i> standing in the same
relation to certain earlier forms, as the Rabbinism
of the Talmud, or the Romanism of the fathers
does to primitive Judaism and Christianity. The
pre-eminence of a sacred caste&mdash;the sanctitude of
the cow&mdash;an impossible cosmogony&mdash;the worship
of Siva and Vishnu&mdash;and an indefinite sort of
recognition of beings like Rama, Krishna, Kali,
and others, are the leading features here; the
recognition of the Ramas and Krishnas being
of an indefinite and equivocal character, because
the extent to which the elements of their
divine nature are referable to the idea of <i>dead
men deified</i>, or the very opposite notion of <i>Gods<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
become incarnate</i>, are inextricably mixed together.
The Puranas are referable to different dates
between the twelfth and sixth centuries <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The germs of the Brahminism of the Puranas
are the two great epics, the <i>Ramayana</i>, or the
conquest of Hindostan by Rama, and the <i>Mahabharata</i>,
or great war between the Sun and Moon
dynasties. If we call the <i>worship of dead men
deified</i>, Euhemerism, it is the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, to which the Euhemerist elements
of the present Brahminism are to be attributed.
They increased the <i>personality</i> of the previous religion.
This is the natural effect of narrative poetry,
and one of which we may measure the magnitude
by looking at the influence and tendencies of the
great Homeric poems of Greece. It is these
which give us Kali, Rama, Krishna, Siva, and
Vishnu, and which helped to determine the preponderance
of the two last over Brahma&mdash;Brahma
being the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; and
Siva, the Destroyer. The highest antiquity
which has been given to the <i>epics</i> is the second
century <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>; and this is full high enough.</p>

<p>The Brahminism of the "Institutes of Menu,"
the oldest Indian code of laws, is simpler than
that of the epics. Its Euhemerism is less. Nevertheless,
it contains the great text on the caste-system,
the <i>fulcrum</i> of priestly pre-eminence.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="hd1">INSTITUTES OF MENU.</div>

<p class="center noin"><i>Sir Graves Haughton's Translation.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. For the sake of preserving this universe, the Being,
supremely glorious, allotted separate duties to those who
sprang respectively from his mouth, his arm, his thigh, and
his foot.</p>

<p>2. To <i>Br&aacute;hmins</i> he assigned the duties of reading the
<i>Veda</i>, of teaching it, of sacrificing, of assisting others to sacrifice,
of giving alms, <i>if they be rich</i>, and, if <i>indigent</i>, of receiving
gifts.</p>

<p>3. To defend the people, to give alms, to sacrifice, to read
the <i>Veda</i>, to shun the allurements of sensual gratification, are,
in a few words, the duties of a <i>Cshatriya</i>.</p>

<p>4. To keep herds of cattle, to bestow largesses, to sacrifice,
to read the scripture, to carry on trade, to lend at interest, and
to cultivate land, are <i>prescribed or permitted</i> to a <i>Vaisya</i>.</p>

<p>5. One principal duty the Supreme Ruler assigns to a
<i>S&uacute;dra</i>; namely, to serve the before-mentioned classes, without
depreciating their worth.</p>

<p>6. Man is declared purer above the navel; but the Self-Creating
Power declared the purest part of him to be his
mouth.</p>

<p>7. Since the Br&aacute;hmin sprang from the most excellent part,
since he was the first born, and since he possesses the <i>Veda</i>,
he is by right the chief of this whole creation.</p>

<p>8. Him, the Being, who exists of himself, produced in the
beginning, from his own mouth, that having performed holy
rites, he might present clarified butter to the gods, and cakes
of rice to the progenitors of mankind, for the preservation of
this world.</p>

<p>9. What created being then can surpass Him, with whose<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
mouth the gods of the firmament continually feast on clarified
butter, and the manes of ancestors, on hallowed cakes?</p>

<p>10. Of created things, the most excellent are those which
are animated; of the animated, those which subsist by intelligence;
of the intelligent, mankind; and of men, the sacerdotal
class.</p>

<p>11. Of priests those eminent in learning; of the learned,
those who know their duty; of those who know it, such as
perform it virtuously; and of the virtuous, those who seek
beatitude from a perfect acquaintance with scriptural doctrine.</p>

<p>12. The very birth of <i>Br&aacute;hmins</i> is a constant incarnation
of <span class="smcap">Dherma</span>, <i>God of Justice</i>; for the <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i> is born to promote
justice, and to procure ultimate happiness.</p>

<p>13. When a <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i> springs to light, he is borne above
the world, the chief of all creatures, assigned to guard the
treasury of duties, religious and civil.</p>

<p>14. Whatever exists in the universe, is all in effect, <i>though
not in form</i>, the wealth of the <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i>; since the <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i>
is entitled to it all by his primogeniture and eminence of
birth.</p>

<p>15. The <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i> eats but his own food; wears but his
own apparel; and bestows but his own in alms: through the
benevolence of the <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i>, indeed, other mortals enjoy
life.</p>

<p>16. To declare the sacerdotal duties, and those of the other
classes in due order, the sage <span class="smcap">Menu</span>, sprung from the self-existing,
promulged this code of laws.</p>

<p>17. A code which must be studied with extreme care by
every learned <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i>, and fully explained to his disciples,
but <i>must be taught</i> by no other man <i>of an inferior class</i>.</p>

<p>18. The <i>Br&aacute;hmin</i> who studies this book, having performed
sacred rites, is perpetually free from offence in thought, in
word, and in deed.</p>

<p>19. He confers purity on his living family, on his ancestors,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and on his descendants, as far as the seventh person; and He
alone deserves to possess this whole earth.</p></div>

<p>Subtract from the Brahminism of the Institutes,
the importance assigned to caste; substitute
for the Euhemerism of the Epics, an <i>elemental
religion</i>, and we ascend to the religion of the
Vedas; the nominal, but only the nominal basis,
of all Hinduism. In the following Vedaic hymns,
<i>Agni</i> is <i>fire</i>; <i>Indra</i>, the <i>sky</i>, <i>firmament</i>, or <i>atmosphere</i>;
and <i>Marut</i>, the <i>cloud</i>.</p>

<p>1. I glorify <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, the high priest of the sacrifice, the

<p>2. May that <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, who is to be celebrated by both ancient

<p>3. Through <span class="smcap">Agni</span> the worshipper obtains that affluence,
which increases day by day, which is the source of fame and
the multiplier of mankind.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, the unobstructed sacrifice of which thou art on
every side the protector, assuredly reaches the gods.</p>

<p>5. May <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, the presenter of oblations, the attainer of
knowledge; he who is true, renowned, and divine, come
hither with the gods!</p>

<p>6. Whatever good thou mayest, <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, bestow upon the
giver (of the oblation), that verily, <span class="smcap">Angiras</span>, shall revert to

<p>7. We approach thee, <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, with reverential homage in
our thoughts, daily, both morning and evening.</p>

<p>8. Thee, the radiant, the protector of sacrifices, the constant
illuminator of truth, increasing in thine own dwelling!</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Agni</span>, be unto us easy of access, as is a father to a son;
be ever present with us for our good!</p>

<div class="hd1">II.</div>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">A&#347;wins</span>, cherishers of pious acts, long-armed, accept
with outstretched hands the sacrificial viands!</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">A&#347;wins</span>, abounding in mighty acts, guides (of devotion),
endowed with fortitude, listen with unaverted minds to our

<p>3. <span class="smcap">A&#347;wins</span>, destroyers of foes, exempt from untruth,
leaders in the van of heroes, come to the mixed libations
sprinkled on the lopped sacred grass!</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, of wonderful splendour, come hither; these libations,
ever pure, expressed by the fingers (of the priests), are
desirous of thee!</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, apprehended by the understanding and appreciated
by the wise, approach and accept the prayers (of the
priest), as he offers the libation!</p>

<p>6. Fleet <span class="smcap">Indra</span> with the tawny coursers, come hither to the
prayers (of the priests), and in this libation accept our (proffered)
food.</p>

<p>7. Universal Gods! protectors and supporters of men, bestowers
(of rewards), come to the libation of the worshipper!</p>

<p>8. May the swift-moving universal Gods, the shedders of
rain, come to the libation, as the solar rays come 'diligently'
to the days!</p>

<p>9. May the universal Gods, who are exempt from decay,
omniscient, devoid of malice, and bearers of riches, accept the

<p>10. May <span class="smcap">Saraswat&iacute;</span>, the purifier, the bestower of food, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Saraswat&iacute;</span>, the inspirer of those who delight in truth,
the instructress of the right-minded, has accepted our sacrifice!</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Saraswat&iacute;</span> makes manifest by her acts a mighty river,
and (in her own form) enlightens all understandings.</p>

<p>1. Come, <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, and be regaled with all viands and libations,
and thence, mighty in strength, be victorious (over thy

<p>2. The libation being prepared, present the exhilarating
and efficacious (draught) to the rejoicing <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, the accomplisher
of all things.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, with the handsome chin, be pleased with these
animating praises: do thou, who art to be reverenced by all
mankind, (come) to these rites (with the gods)!</p>

<p>4. I have addressed to thee, <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, the showerer (of blessings),
the protector (of thy worshippers), praises which have
reached thee, and of which thou hast approved!</p>

<p>5. Place before us, <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, precious and multiform riches,
for enough, and more than enough, are assuredly thine!</p>

<p>6. Opulent <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, encourage us in this rite for the acquirement
of wealth, for we are diligent and renowned!</p>

<p>7. Grant us, <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, wealth beyond measure or calculation,
inexhaustible, the source of cattle, of food, of all life.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, grant us great renown and wealth acquired in a
thousand ways, and those (articles) of food (which are brought
from the field) in carts!</p>

<p>9. We invoke, for the preservation of our property, <span class="smcap">Indra</span>,
the lord of wealth, the object of sacred verses, the repairer (to
the place of sacrifice), praising him with our praises!</p>

<p>10. With libations repeatedly effused, the sacrificer glorifies<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the vast prowess of <span class="smcap">Indra</span>, the mighty, the dweller in (an
eternal mansion)!</p>

<div class="hd1">IV.</div>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Maruts</span> who are going forth decorate themselves
like females: they are gliders (through the air), the sons of
<span class="smcap">Rudra</span>, and the doers of good works, by which they promote
the welfare of earth and heaven: heroes, who grind (the solid
rocks), they delight in sacrifices!</p>

<p>2. They, inaugurated by the gods, have attained majesty,
the sons of <span class="smcap">Rudra</span> have established their dwelling above the
sky: glorifying him (<span class="smcap">Indra</span>) who merits to be glorified, they
have inspired him with vigour: the sons of <span class="smcap">Prisni</span> have acquired
dominion!</p>

<p>3. When the sons of the earth embellish themselves with
ornaments, they shine resplendent in their persons with (brilliant)
decorations; they keep aloof every adversary: the waters
follow their path!</p>

<p>4. They who are worthily worshipped shine with various
weapons: incapable of being overthrown, they are the overthrowers
(of mountains): <span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, swift as thought, intrusted
with the duty of sending rain, yoke the spotted deer to your
cars!</p>

<p>5. When <span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, urging on the cloud, for the sake of (providing)
food, you have yoked the deer to your chariots, the
drops fall from the radiant (sun), and moisten the earth, like
a hide, with water!</p>

<p>6. Let your quick-paced smooth-gliding coursers bear you
(hither), and, moving swiftly, come with your hands filled
with good things: sit, <span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, upon the broad seat of sacred
grass, and regale yourselves with the sweet sacrificial food!</p>

<p>7. Confiding in their own strength, they have increased in
(power); they have attained heaven by their greatness, and
have made (for themselves) a spacious abode: may they, for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
whom <span class="smcap">Vishnu</span> defends (the sacrifice) that bestows all desires
and confers delight, come (quickly) like birds, and sit down
upon the pleasant and sacred grass!</p>

<p>8. Like heroes, like combatants, like men anxious for food,
the swift-moving (<span class="smcap">Maruts</span>) have engaged in battles: all beings
fear the <span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, who are the leaders (of the rain), and awful
of aspect, like princes!</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Indra</span> wields the well-made, golden, many-bladed thunderbolt,
which the skilful <span class="smcap">Twashtri</span> has framed for him, that
he may achieve great exploits in war. He has slain <span class="smcap">Vritra</span>,
and sent forth an ocean of water!</p>

<p>10. By their power, they bore the well aloft, and clove
asunder the mountain that obstructed their path: the munificent
<span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, blowing upon their pipe, have conferred,
when exhilarated by the <i>soma</i> juice, desirable (gifts upon
the sacrificer)!</p>

<p>11. They brought the crooked well to the place (where the
<i>Muni</i> was), and sprinkled the water upon the thirsty <span class="smcap">Gotama</span>:
the variously-radiant (<span class="smcap">Maruts</span>) come to his succour,
gratifying the desire of the sage with life-sustaining waters!</p>

<p>12. Whatever blessings (are diffused) through the three
worlds, and are in your gift, do you bestow upon the donor (of
the libation), who addresses you with praise; bestow them,
also, <span class="smcap">Maruts</span>, upon us, and grant us, bestowers of all good,
riches, whence springs prosperity!</p></div>

<p>If we investigate the antiquity of these hymns
we shall find no definite and unimpeachable date.
Their epoch is assigned on the score of internal
evidence. The language is so much more archaic
than that of the Institutes, and the mythology
so much simpler; whilst the Institutes
themselves are similarly circumstanced in respect<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the Epics. Fixing these at about 200, <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>;
we allow so many centuries for the archaisms
of Menu, and so many more for those of the
Vedas. For the whole, eleven hundred has not
been thought too little, which places the Vedas in
the fourteenth century, <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, and makes them the
earliest, or nearly the earliest records in the
world.</p>

<p>It is clear that this is but an approximation,
and, although all inquirers admit that creeds,
languages, and social conditions present the
phenomena of <i>growth</i>, the opinions as to the <i>rate</i>
of such growths are varied, and none of much
value. This is because the particular induction
required for the formation of anything better than
a mere impression has yet to be undertaken&mdash;till
when, one man's guess is as good as another's.
The age of a tree may be reckoned from its concentric
rings, but the age of a language, a doctrine,
or a polity, has neither bark nor wood, neither
teeth like a horse, nor a register like a child.</p>

<p>Now the antiquity of the Vedas, as inferred
from the archaic character of their language, has
been shaken by the discovery of the structure of
the Persepolitan dialect of the arrow-headed inscriptions.
It approaches that of the Vedas;
being, in some points, older than the Sanskrit of
Menu. Yet its date is less than 500, <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> Again,
the Pali is less archaic than the Sanskrit; yet the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Pali is the language of the oldest inscriptions in
India, indeed, of the oldest Indian records of any
sort, with a definite date.</p>

<p>One of the few cases where the phenomena of
<i>rate</i> have been studied with due attention, is in
the evolution of the three languages of Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden out of the Icelandic. What
does this tell us? The last has altered so slowly
that a modern Icelander can read the oldest works of
his language. In Sweden, however, the speech <i>has</i>
altered. So it has in Denmark; whilst both these
languages are unintelligible to the Icelander,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. As to their respective changes,
Petersen shows that the Danish was always
about a hundred years forwarder than the Swedish,
having attained that point at (say) 1200, which
the Swedish did not reach till 1300. Both, however,
changed; and that, at a uniform rate; the
Danish having, as it were, the start of a century.
The Norwegian, however, comported itself differently.
Until the Reformation it hardly changed
at all; less than the stationary Icelandic itself.
Fifty years, however, of sudden and rapid transformation
brought it, at once, to the stage which
the Danish had been three hundred years in reaching.
How many times must the observation of
such phenomena be multiplied before we can
strike an average as to the rate of change in languages,
creeds, and polities?<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Again&mdash;it is by no means certain that the
Institutes and the Vedas represent a contemporary
state of things. All doctrinal writings
contain something appertaining to a period older
than that of their composition.</p>

<p>Lastly,&mdash;the proof that all the writings in
question belong to the same linear series, and
represent the growth of <i>the same phenomena in the
same place</i> is deficient. The &AElig;gyptologist believes
that contemporary kings are mistaken for
successive ones; the philologist, that difference
of dialects simulates a difference of age. Doubts
of a more specific nature dawn upon us when we
attempt to realize the alphabet in which an
Indian MS. of even only eight hundred years
<span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, was written. No Indian MS. is fifteen
hundred years old; no inscription older than
Alexander's time. Nevertheless,&mdash;though I write
upon this subject with diffidence&mdash;the Devanagari
characters of the Sanskrit MSS. can be deduced
from the alphabet of the inscriptions;
whilst these inscriptions themselves approach the
alphabets of the Semitic character in proportion
to their antiquity: so that the oldest alphabet
of the Vedas is referable to that of the
inscriptions, and that of the inscriptions betrays
an origin external to India. Its introduction
<i>may</i> be very early; nevertheless its epoch must
be investigated with a full recognition of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
comparatively modern date of even the earliest
alphabets of Persia, and the parts westward; early
as compared with such a date as 1400, <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, the
accredited epoch of the Vedas; an epoch, perhaps,
a thousand years too early.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the existence of an alphabet,
an architecture, a coinage, and an algebra at a
period which no scepticism puts much later than
250, <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, is so undoubted, that they may pass as
ethnological facts, <i>i.e.</i>, facts sufficiently true to
be not merely admitted with what is called an
<i>otiose</i> belief, but to be classed with the most unexceptionable
<i>data</i> of history, and to be used as
effects from which we may argue backwards&mdash;<i>more
ethnologico</i>&mdash;to their antecedent causes; the
appreciation of these requiring a philosophy and
an induction of its own.</p>

<p>We cannot detract from the antiquity of Indian
civilization without impugning its indigenous
origin, nor doubt this without stirring the question
as to the countries from which it was introduced.
These have been Persia, Assyria, Egypt,
and Greece; the introduction being direct or
indirect as the case might be.</p>

<p>In this way are contrasted the views of the
general ethnologist, with those of the special orientalist,
in respect to the great and difficult question
of Indian antiquity. Yet, how far does the scepticism
of the former affect our views concerning<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the descent of the Hind&uacute;s, the Mahrattas, the
Bengali, and those other populations, to the
languages whereof they applied? Not much.
Whichever way we decide, the population may
still be Tamulian; only, in case we make the
language Sanskritic, it is Tamulian in the same
way as the Cornish are Welsh; <i>i.e.</i>, Tamulian
with a change of tongue.</p>

<p>The doubts, too, as to the antiquity of the
Sanskrit literature unsettle but little. They
merely make the introduction of certain foreign
elements some centuries later.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the oldest of the great
Hind&uacute; creeds, that of the <i>Sikhs</i> is the newest. Its
founder, Nanuk, in the fifteenth century, was a
contemplative enthusiast; his successor, Govind,
a zealous man of action; himself succeeded by
similar <i>g&uacute;r&uacute;s</i>, or priests, who eventually, by
means of fanaticism, organization, and union
with the state raised the power of the <i>Khalsa</i>
to the formidable height from which it has so
lately fallen. <i>Truth</i> is the great abstraction of the
Sikh creeds; and the extent to which it is at
once intolerant and eclectic may be seen from the
following extracts.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> They certainly present the
doctrine in a favourable light.</p>

<h3>PARTS BEYOND THE INDUS.</h3>

<p>The Punj&acirc;b is the most western locality of the
Indian stock, whether we call the members of it
Hind&uacute; or Tamulian. On crossing the Indus we
reach a new ethnological area, only partially,
and only recently British; <i>viz.</i>, the country of the
Bil&uacute;ch, and the country of the Afghans. And
here we must prepare for new terms; for hearing
of <i>tribes</i> rather than <i>castes</i>; and for finding a
polity more like that of the Jews and Arabs than
the institutions of the Brahmins.</p>

<p><i>The Bil&uacute;ch.</i>&mdash;<i>Biluchi-stan</i> means the country of
the <i>Bil&uacute;ch</i>, just as <i>Hindo-stan</i> and <i>Afghani-stan</i>
mean that of the Hind&uacute;s and Afghans. It is the
south-western quarter of Persia, that is the chief
area of the tribes in question. Hence, however,
they extend into Kutch Gundava, Scinde, and
M&uacute;ltan, and the northern parts of Gujerat.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Between Kelat, the Indus, and the sea, they are
mixed with Brah&uacute;i.</p>

<p>The Biluchi is a dialect of the Persian&mdash;sufficiently
close to be understood by a Persian
proper.</p>

<p>There are no grounds for believing the Bil&uacute;ch
to have been other than the aborigines of the
country which they occupy; as their advent lies
beyond the historical period; beyond the pale of
admissible tradition. We may, perhaps, be told
that they came from Arabia; an origin which
their Mahometanism, their division into tribes,
and their manners, suggest; an origin, too,
which their physiognomy by no means impugns.
Yet the tradition is not only unsupported, but
equivocal. The <i>Arabia</i> that it refers to is, probably,
the country of the ancient <i>Arabit&aelig;</i>; and
that is neither more nor less than a part of the
province of Mekran, within&mdash;or nearly within&mdash;the
present Bil&uacute;ch domain. Hence, they may be
<i>Arabite</i>, though not <i>Arabian</i>; or rather the old
<i>Arabit&aelig;</i> of the <i>Arabius fluvius</i> were Bil&uacute;ch.</p>

<p>But the Arabs are not the only members of the
Semitic family with which the Bil&uacute;ch have been
affiliated. A multiplicity of Jewish characteristics
has been discerned. These are all the more
visible from their contrast to the manners of the
Hind&uacute;s. Intermediate in appearance to the
Hind&uacute; and the Persian, the Bil&uacute;ch "cast of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
feature is certainly Jewish;"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> his tribual divisions
are equally so; whilst the Levitical punishment
of adultery by stoning, and the transmission
of the widow of a deceased brother to the brothers
who survive, have been duly recognized as Hebrew
characteristics. We know what follows all this;
as surely as smoke shows fire. Levitical peculiarities
suggest the ubiquitous decad of the lost
tribes of Israel. We shall soon hear of these
again.</p>

<p>Tribes under chiefs&mdash;hereditary succession&mdash;pride
of blood&mdash;clannish sentiments&mdash;feuds between
tribe and tribe&mdash;the sacro-sanctity of revenge
as a duty&mdash;the suspension of private wars
when foreign foes threaten&mdash;greater rudeness
amongst the mountains&mdash;comparative industry in
the plains&mdash;the business of robbery tempered by
the duties of hospitality&mdash;black mail, &amp;c. All
this is equally Bil&uacute;ch, Arabian, and Highland
Scotch; and it all shows the similarity of details
which accompanies similarity of social institutions.
Ethnological relationship it does <i>not</i> show.</p>

<p>The word <i>Bil&uacute;ch</i> is Persian. The bearer of the
designation either calls himself by the name of
his tribe, or else glorifies himself by the term
<i>Usul</i> or <i>Pure</i>. The tribes or <i>khoums</i> are numerous.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Sir H. Pottinger gives the names of no less
than fifty-eight; without going into their subdivisions.</p>

<p>If, however, instead of details, we seek for
classes of greater generality we find that <i>three</i>
primary divisions comprise all the ramifications of
the Bil&uacute;ch. The first of these is the <i>Rind</i>; the
other two are the <i>Nihro</i> and the <i>Mughsi</i>. The
daughter of a Rind may be given to a Rind as a
wife; but to marry into a tribe of Nihro or
Mughsi extraction is a degradation. Here the
elements of <i>caste</i> intermix with those of <i>tribe</i> or
<i>clan</i>.</p>

<p><i>Afghans.</i>&mdash;<i>Afghani-stan</i> means the country of
the Afghans, just as <i>Hindo-stan</i> and <i>Biluchi-stan</i>
mean that of the Hind&uacute;s and Biluchi, respectively.</p>

<p>In India the Afghans are called <i>Patan</i>.</p>

<p>Their language is called <i>Pushtu</i>. It is allied
to the Persian&mdash;but less closely than the Bil&uacute;ch.</p>

<p>Fully and accurately described in the admirable
work of Lord Mountstuart Elphinstone, the
Afghans have long commanded the attention of
the ethnologist; and all that has been said about
the Judaism of the Biluchi has been said in
respect to them also, though not by so good a
writer as the one just quoted. No wonder. Their
tribual organization, if not more peculiar in character,
has been more minutely described; a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
greater massiveness of frame and feature has been
looked upon as eminently Judaic; and, lastly, an
incorrect statement of Sir William Jones's, as to
the Hebrew character of the Pushtu language, has
added the authority of that respected scholar to
the doctrine of the Semitic origin of the Afghans.
Against this, however, stands the evidence of their
peculiar and hitherto unplaced language. I say
<i>unplaced</i>, because the criticism that separates the
modern dialects of Hindostan from the Sanskrit,
disconnects the Pushtu and the old Persian.
Nevertheless, it is anything but either Hebrew or
Arabic.</p>

<p>Similarity of political constitution, and its attendant
spirit of independence, have given a political
importance to both the Bil&uacute;ch and the
Afghan. Each is but partially&mdash;very partially&mdash;British;
and each became dependent upon Britain,
not because they were the Afghans and
Bil&uacute;ch of their own rugged countries, but because
they were part and parcel of certain territories
in India. It was on the Indus that they were conquered;
and it as Indians that they are British.</p>

<p>Four great patriarchs are the hypothetical progenitors
of the four primary Afghan divisions&mdash;though
it is uncertain whether any such quaternion
be more of an historical reality than the four
castes of Brahminism. Subordinate to these four
heads is the division called <i>Ul&uacute;s</i> (<i>Ooloos</i>).<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>A minuter knowledge of the Afghan affiliations&mdash;real
or supposed&mdash;is to be gained by premising
that <i>khail</i> has much the same meaning as the
Bil&uacute;ch <i>khoum</i>, so that it denotes a division of
population which we may call <i>clan</i>, <i>tribe</i>, or <i>sept</i>;
whilst the affix -<i>zye</i>, means <i>sons</i> or <i>offspring</i>.
Hence, <i>Eusof-zye</i> is equivalent to what an Arab
would call <i>Beni Yusuf</i>; a Greek, <i>Ioseph-id&aelig;</i>; or
a Highland Gael, <i>MacJoseph</i>. All this is clear.
When, however, we try to give precision to our
nomenclature, and ask whether the <i>khail</i> contains
a number of -<i>zye</i>, or the -<i>zye</i> a number of <i>khails</i>,
difficulties begin. Sometimes the one, sometimes
the other is the larger class. And a <i>khail</i> in one
case may be divided into groups ending in -<i>zye</i>;
in others, a group denoted by -<i>zye</i> may contain
two or more <i>khails</i>. Each is a <i>generic</i> or <i>specific</i>
designation as the case may be.</p>

<p>However, to proceed to instances, the following
groups of Afghans may be constituted.</p>

<p>1. Three sections&mdash;the <i>Acco-zye</i>, the <i>Mulle-zye</i>,
and the <i>Lawe-zye</i>&mdash;are subdivisions of the&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>Eusof.</i>&mdash;The Eusof and <i>Munder</i> being
branches of the&mdash;</p>

<p>3. <i>Eusof-zye.</i>&mdash;Now the <i>Eusof-zye</i> is one out
of four divisions of the&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>Khukkhi.</i>&mdash;The <i>Guggiani</i>, <i>Turcolani</i>, and
<i>Mahomed-zye</i>, being the other three.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, the <i>Khukkhi</i>, the <i>Otman-khail</i>, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<i>Khyberi</i>, the <i>Bungush</i>, the <i>Khuttuk</i> and, probably,
some others form the <i>Berdurani</i> Afghans.</p>

<p>But as <i>Berdurani</i> is a geographical, or political,
rather than a tribual designation; as it is the
name by which the <i>north</i>-eastern Afghans were
known to the Moghuls; and as it is equivalent to
such an expression as <i>Western</i> or <i>Eastern Highlander</i>,
rather than to names so specific as <i>Campbell</i>
or <i>MacDonald</i>, it may be excluded from the
true Afghan affiliations.</p>

<p>With this deduction, however, the classification
is sufficiently complex; besides which, it
is, probably, much more systematic on paper
than in reality. This, however, can only be
indicated.</p>

<p>The valley of Peshawar is the valley of the
<i>Guggiani</i>, and <i>Mahomed-zye</i> Afghans.</p>

<p>The parts round it belong to the <i>Eusof-zye</i>, the
<i>Otman-khail</i>, the <i>Turcolani</i>, the <i>Momunds</i>, and
the <i>Khyberi</i> of the Khyber Range and Pass.
These last fall into the <i>Afridi</i>, the <i>Shainwari</i>,
and the <i>Uruk-zye</i>. Their country is chiefly to
the north of the Salt Range.</p>

<p>The river K&uacute;r&uacute;m gives us the two valleys of
Dowr and Bunn&uacute;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;the <i>Bunn&uacute;chi</i> being as pre-eminently<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a mixed, as the mountaineers around
them&mdash;the <i>Vizeri</i>&mdash;are a pure branch. These,
and others, appear to belong to the great <i>Khuttuk</i>
division.</p>

<p>The <i>south</i>-eastern Afghans are called <i>Lohani</i>;
and, as a proof of this designation being of the
same geographico-political character as <i>Berdurani</i>,
the Khuttuk Afghans are divided between the
two sections; at least the particular Khuttuks
called <i>Murwuti</i> are mentioned as Lohani, though
the Khuttuk class in general is placed in the Berdurani
branch. The chief Lohani Afghans are
the <i>Shir&aacute;ni</i> near the Tukt-i-Solim&aacute;n mountain,
and the <i>Stori&aacute;ni</i> (<i>Storeeanees</i>, <i>Oosteraunees</i>) conterminous
with the most northern of the Bil&uacute;ch.</p>

<p>Of these the B&uacute;gti and Murri are the chief
populations of the frontier; whilst the <i>N&uacute;tkani</i>,
<i>K&uacute;srani</i>, <i>Lund</i>, <i>Lughari</i>, <i>Gurkhari</i>, <i>Mudari</i>, and
others, help to fill up the Muckelwand (or the
parts immediately along the course of the Indus),
and the Bil&uacute;ch portions of M&uacute;ltan.</p>

<p><i>The Brah&uacute;i.</i>&mdash;The Brah&uacute;i, with whom it has
been stated that the Bil&uacute;ch are intermixed, are
pastoral tribes, with a coarser physiognomy, and
a stouter make than their neighbours. Their language
also is different. A specimen of it may be
found amongst the well-known and important
vocabularies of Lieutenant Leach; and this forms
the subject of a memoir of no less a scholar than<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Lassen. Without placing it, he remarks that
the numerals are <i>South</i>-Indian (or Tamulian)
rather than aught else. He might have said
more. The Brah&uacute;i is a remarkable and unexplained
branch of the Tamul; but whether it be
of late introduction or indigenous origin in the
parts where it now occurs is uncertain. The
mountains between Kutch Gundava and Mekran
seem to form the area of the Brah&uacute;i; some eastern
branches of which population I presume to be
British, mixed with Bil&uacute;ch.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Ceylon.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of the northern part
of Ceylon speak the Tamul language, and are
Brahminists in creed. They are not, however,
the true natives of the island. These latter use a
Hind&uacute; tongue, called the <i>Singhalese</i>. Its philological
relations are exactly those of the Mahratta,
Bengali, and Udiya,&mdash;neither better nor
worse defined, more or less unequivocal. Some
make it out to be of Sanskrit, others of Tamulian
origin. All that is certain is, that it is
more Sanskritic than the proper Tamul, and
more Tamul than the Bengali. It is <i>written</i>;
and embodies a copious, but worthless literature,
its alphabet being derived from that of the
Pali language.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>This introduces a new characteristic. The
Pali has the same relation to Buddhism, that
the Sanskrit has to Brahminism. It is the
language of the Scriptures, the priest, and the
scholar, and, although, at the present moment,
it is as little recognized as a holy tongue on
the continent of India, as the Greek of the
New Testament is at Rome, it divides with the
Arabic and Latin, the honour of being the
most widely-spread literary language of the
world. All the forms of Buddhism in the transgangetic
peninsula are embodied in Pali writings.
So are those of the Mongols; and so, to a great
extent, those of the Tibetans as well. This makes
the language and the creed nearly co-extensive.
In China, however, and Japan, where great
changes have taken place, and where either the
development, or the deterioration of Buddhism
has gone far enough to abolish the more palpable
characteristics of the original Indian doctrine, the
Pali language is no longer the medium. It <i>is</i> so,
however, for the vast area already indicated.</p>

<p>In Buddhism, as opposed to Brahminism, there
is a greater tenderness of animal life in general,
whilst less respect is paid to the ox-tribe in particular.
There is less also of the system of caste;
and, in consequence of this, fewer of those elements
of priestly influence, which originate in the
ideas of the hereditary transmission of sacro-sanctitude.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Buddhism, too, has the credit of running
further in the dream-land of subjective metaphysics
than Brahminism,&mdash;though this, as far as
my own very imperfect means of judging go, is
doubtful. Into practical pantheism, and into the
deification of human reason it <i>does</i> run.</p>

<p>When self-contemplation has reached its highest
degree of abstraction, the state of <i>Nirwana</i> is
induced. This seems to mean the absorption
of the spirit within itself; a condition which at
once suggests adjectives like <i>impassive</i>, <i>subjective</i>,
<i>exalted</i>, and <i>supra-sensual</i>, or substantives like
<i>transcendentalism</i>, <i>egoism</i>, &amp;c., and the like; in
some cases with definite ideas to correspond with
the term; oftener as mere meaningless words.
Such, however, is the nomenclature which is requisite;
a nomenclature to which I have recourse,
not for the sake of illustrating my subject, but
with the view of giving a practical notion of its
indistinctness.</p>

<p>Buddha himself is a specimen and model of
self-absorption, consummation, perfection, or exaltation
rather than a deity, or even a prophet.
He shows what purity can effect, rather than
teaches what purity consists in. He may even
have become what he was, by his own unaided
powers of supra-sensual abstraction.</p>

<p>All this is but a series of negations, at least in
the way of theology. But his spirit, after the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
departure of his body from the earth,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> became
incarnate in the body of some successor&mdash;and so
on <i>ad infinitum</i>. This connects Buddhism with
the doctrine of metempsychosis; a doctrine which
the incarnations of Brahminism also suggest.</p>

<p>Such are some of the speculative points of
Buddhism. Its morality has been greatly, and,
perhaps, unduly extolled. So much contemplation
can scarcely exist without the condemnation
of the more palpable sins of <i>commission</i>.
Hence, those vices which are the offspring of
passion and ignorance are condemned; as is but
natural. The suspension of exertion precludes
active vice. Of the active virtues, however, the
recognition is as slight as may be; so slight as to
make it doubtful whether Buddhism be a better
rule for the formation of good citizens than Brahminism.
Which has been the most resistant to
the influences of Christianity is doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Just as the Anglo-Saxon language, although it
originated in Germany, has survived and developed
itself in Britain only, the Buddhist creed,
once indigenous to the continent of Hindostan,
is now found nowhere between the Himalayas
and Cape Comorin; whilst beyond the pale<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of India, it is as widely extended as the English
language is beyond the limits of Germany. The
rival religion of the Brahmins expelled it. Which
of the two was the older is uncertain. Still more
difficult is it to determine how far each is a separate
substantive mythological growth, or merely a
modification of the rival creed.</p>

<p>I lay but little stress upon the internal evidence
derivable from the character of the religions
themselves. Both are complicated and
artificial&mdash;both, perhaps, equally so. In contrast,
however, to the more speculative and
transcendental points, suggestive of recent development,
there are others indicative of great
antiquity. Nevertheless, it is as difficult to affirm
that the primitive parts of the one creed are
older than the most primitive parts of the other,
as it is to affirm that the highest transcendentalisms
are more recent.</p>

<p>The fact of the oldest inscriptions being in the
Pali dialect, is favourable to the greater antiquity
of Buddhism, but it is not conclusive. The
notion that Sanskrit itself is comparatively recent,
of course subtracts from that of Brahminism.
But this is far from being admitted. Besides
which, it by no means follows, that because Brahminism
is, comparatively speaking, recent, Buddhism
must be ancient.</p>

<p>The best clue in this labyrinth of conflicting<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
opinions is the study of the superstitions of the
ruder tribes of the hill-ranges of India itself, of
the sub-Himalayas, and of the Indo-Chinese peninsula;
the result of which investigation will be
that that creed which has most points in common
with the primitive and unmodified mythologies of
the Tamulian stock, and of those branches of the
monosyllabic populations nearest akin thereto,
has also the best claim to be considered as the
older.</p>

<p>In my own mind, I believe that the <i>Bedo</i> of
the Rajmahali mountaineers, is the <i>Batho</i> of the
Bodo, the <i>Pennu</i> of the Khonds, and the <i>Potteang</i>
of the Kukis,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>&mdash;name for name. I believe this
without doubt or hesitation. But if I ask myself
the import of this identity, the answer is unsatisfactory.
There is doubt and hesitation in
abundance. <i>Bedo</i>, <i>Batho</i>, <i>Petto</i>, and <i>Potteang</i>,
<i>may</i> represent the germ of what afterwards became
<i>Buddh-ism</i>. They may exhibit the Indian creed
in its <i>rudiments</i>. True. But they may also represent
it in its <i>fragments</i>, so that <i>Bedo</i> and <i>Batho</i>
may be but <i>Buddh</i>, distorted in form, and but
imperfectly comprehended in import. In our
own Gospel, the name for the place of punishment,
which the Greeks called <i>Hades</i>, and the
Hebrews typified by <i>Gehenna</i>, is the name of a
Saxon goddess <i>Hela</i>; and, in this particular instance,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a point of our original paganism has been
taken up into our present Christianity. The
same is the case with the Finnic nation, where
<i>Yumala</i> signifies <i>God</i>; Yumala being as truly
heathen as <i>Jupiter</i>. On the other hand we find
amongst the genuine pagan Gallas of Africa, an
object of respect or worship called <i>Miriam</i>.
What is this? No true piece of heathendom at
all. Dr. Beke has given good reasons for believing
that it means the Virgin Mother of the Saviour,
the only extant member of the Christian Revelation
now known to that once imperfectly Christianized
community.</p>

<p>Buddhism, then, may claim a higher antiquity
than Brahminism under the two following conditions.</p>

<p>1. That the names <i>Batho</i>, &amp;c., be really a
form of <i>Buddh</i>.</p>

<p>2. That they have belonged to superstitions in
which they occur from the beginning; and are
not in the same category with the <i>Miriam</i> of the
Gallas, <i>i.e.</i>, recent introductions from a wholly
different religion&mdash;grafts rather than embryos.</p>

<p>How far this latter is the case must be ascertained
by a wide and minute inquiry, foreign to
the present work.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that, side by side with a semi-philosophical
creed like Buddhism, we should
have such a phenomenon as Devil-worship. When<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the spirit falls short of its due degree of self-sustained
hardihood, fear finds its way to the
heart. The evil powers are then propitiated;
sometimes in a manner savouring of dignity,
sometimes with groveling and grotesque cowardice.
The Yezid of Mesopotamia, whose belief in the
power of an evil spirit is derived from the Manicheism
of old, shows his fear of the arch-enemy
by simple and not unreasonable acts of negation.
He does nothing that may offend; never mentions
his name; and dwells on his attributes as
little as possible. The devil-worshipper of
Ceylon uses such invocations as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hd1">I.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Come, thou <i>sanguinary Devil</i>, at the sixth hour. Come,
thou <i>fierce Devil</i>, upon this stage, and accept the offerings
made to thee!</p>

<p>The <i>ferocious Devil</i> seems to be coming measuring the
ground by the length of his feet, and giving warnings of his
approach by throwing stones and sand round about. He looks
upon the meat-offering which is kneaded with blood and
boiled rice.</p>

<p>He stands there and plays in the shade of the tree called
<i>Demby</i>. He removes the sickness of the person which he
caused. He will accept the offerings prepared with blood,
odour, and reddish boiled rice. Prepare these offerings in the
shade of the <i>Demby</i> tree.</p>

<p>Make a female figure of the <i>planets</i> with a monkey's face,
and its body the colour of gold. Offer four offerings in the
four corners. In the left corner, place some blood, and for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
victims a fowl and a goat. In the evening, place the scene
representing the planets on the high ground.</p>

<p>The face resembles a monkey's face, and the head is the
colour of gold. The head is reddish, and the bunch of hair is
black and tied. He holds blood in the left-hand, and rides on
a bullock. After this manner make the sanguinary figure of
the planets.</p>

<div class="hd1">II.</div>

<p>O thou great devil <i>Maha-Sohon</i>, preserve these sick persons
without delay!</p>

<p>On the way, as he was going, by supernatural power he
made a great noise. He fought with the form of <i>Wessamoony</i>,
and wounded his head. The planet <i>Saturn</i> saw a wolf in the
midst of the forest, and broke his neck. The <i>Wessamoony</i>
gave permission to the great devil called <i>Maha-Sohon</i>.</p>

<p>O thou great devil <i>Maha-Sohon</i>, take away these sicknesses
by accepting the offerings made frequently to thee.&mdash;The
qualities of this devil are these: he stretches his long chin,
and opens wide his mouth like a cavern: he bears a spear in
his right-hand, and grasps a great and strong elephant with his
left-hand. He is watching and expecting to drink the blood
of the elephant in the place where the two and three roads
meet together.</p>

<p>Influenced by supernatural power, he entered the body of
the princess called <i>Godimbera</i>. He caused her to be sick
with severe trembling sickness. Come thou poor and powerless
devil <i>Maha-Sohon</i> to fight with me, and leave the princess,
if thou hast sufficient strength.</p>

<p>On hearing these sayings, he left her, and made himself
like a blue cloud, and violently covered his whole body with
flames of fire. Furiously staring with his eyes, he said,
"Art thou come, blockhead, to fight with me who was born in
the world of men? I will take you by the legs, and dash you<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
upon the great rock <i>Maha-meru</i>, and quickly bring you to nothing."</p>

<p>Thou wast born on Sunday, the first day of the month, and
didst receive permission from the <i>King of Death</i>, and didst
brandish a sword like a plantain-leaf. Thou comest down at
half-past seven, to accept the offerings made to thee.</p>

<p>If the devil <i>Maha-Sohon</i> cause the chin-cough, leanness of
the body, thirst, madness, and mad babblings, he will come
down at half-past seven, and accept the offerings made to him.</p>

<p>These are the marks of the devil <i>Maha-Sohon</i>: three marks
on the head, one mark on the eye-brow and on the temple;
three marks on the belly, a shining moon on the thigh, a lighted
torch on the head, an offering and a flower on the breast.
The chief god of the burying-place will say, May you live
long!</p>

<p>Make the figure of the <i>planets</i> called the emblem of the
<i>great burying-place</i>, as follows: a spear grasped by the right-hand,
an elephant's figure in the left-hand, and in the act of
drinking the blood of the elephant by bruising its proboscis.</p>

<p>Tip the point of the spear in the hand with blood, pointed
towards the elephant's face in the left-hand. These effigies
and offerings take and offer in the burying-place,&mdash;discerning
well the sickness by means of the devil-dancer.</p>

<p>Make a figure of the <i>wolf</i> with a large breast, full of hairs
on the body, and with long teeth separated from each other.
The effigy of the <i>Maha-Sohon</i> was made formerly so.</p>

<p>These are the sicknesses which the great devil causes by
living among the tombs: chin-cough, itching of the body, disorders
in the bowels; windy complaints, dropsy, leanness of
the body, weakness and consumptions.</p>

<p>He walks on high upon the lofty stones. He walks on the
ground where three ways meet. Therefore go not in the
roads by night: if you do so, you must not expect to escape
with your life.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Make two figures of a goose, one on each side. Make a
lion and a dog to stand at the left-leg, bearing four drinking-cups
on four paws&mdash;and make a moon's image, and put it in
the burying-place.</p>

<p>Comb the hair, and tie up a large bunch with a black string.
Put round the neck a cobra-capella, and dress him in the garments
by making nine folds round the waist. He stands on a
rock eating men's flesh. The persons that were possessed
with devils are put in the burying-place.</p>

<p>Put a corpse at the feet, taking out the intestines through
the mouth. The principal thing for this country, and for the
Singhalese, is the worship of the planets.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></div>

<p>In the centre of the island is the kingdom of
Kandy; naturally fortified by impervious forests,
and long independent. This creates a variety;
the Kandyans being somewhat ruder than the
other Singhalese. It is not, however, an important
one. The really important ethnology of
Ceylon is that of the <i>Vaddahs</i>, in the eastern
districts, inland of Battacaloa. They are still
unmodified by either the Hind&uacute; habits, or the
great Indian creeds,&mdash;the true analogues of the
Khonds, and K&oacute;ls, and Bhils, &amp;c. Their language,
however, is Singhalese; an important fact,
since it denotes one of two phenomena,&mdash;either
the antiquity of the conquest of Ceylon supposing
the extension of the Singhalese language to have
been gradual, or the thorough-going character of
it, if it be recent.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Who were the <i>Pad&aelig;i</i> of the following extract
from Herodotus?<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>&mdash;"Other Indians there are,
who live east of these. They are nomads, eaters
of raw flesh; and called Pad&aelig;i. They are said
to have the following customs. Whenever one of
their countrymen is sick, whether man or woman,
he is killed. The males kill the males, and
amongst these the most intimate acquaintance
kill their nearest friends; for they say that
for a man to be wasted by disease is for their
own meat to be spoilt. The man denies that he
ails; but they, not letting him have his own way,
kill and feast on him. If a female be sick, the
women that are most intimate with her treat her
as the males do the men. They sacrifice and
feast upon all who arrive at old age. Few, however,
go thus far, since they kill every one who
falls sick before he reaches that stage of life."</p>

<p>Name for name, the <i>Vaddahs</i> of Ceylon have a
claim to be <i>Pad&aelig;i</i>. Besides which they are Indian.</p>

<p>But, name for name, the <i>Battas</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of Sumatra
have a claim as well; and although they are not
exactly Indian, they are cannibals of the sort in
question&mdash;or, at any rate, cannibals in a manner
quite as remarkable.</p>

<p>This gives us a conflict of difficulties. The
solution of them lies in the fact of neither <i>Vaddah</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
nor <i>Batta</i> being <i>native</i> names; a fact which
leaves us a liberty to suppose that the <i>Pad&aelig;i</i> of
Herodotus were simply some wild Indian tribe
sufficiently allied in manners to the <i>Vaddahs</i> of
Ceylon, and the <i>Battas</i> of Sumatra, to be called
by the same name, but without being necessarily
either the one or the other; or even ethnologically
connected with either.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now look at the <i>gipsies</i> of Great Britain.
They are wanderers without fixed habitations;
whilst, at the same time, they are more abundant
in some parts of the island than others. They
have no very definite occupation; yet they are
oftener tinkers and tinmen than aught else equally
legal. They intermarry with the English but
little. All this is <i>caste</i>, although we may not
exactly call it so. Then, again, they have a
peculiar language, although it is so imperfectly
known to the majority of the British gipsies, as
to have become well-nigh extinct.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> These gipsies
are of Indian origin, and a wandering tribe
of Hindostan, called Sikligurs, reminded Mr.
Pickering of the European gipsies more than
any other Indians he fell in with. Like these,
the Sikligurs are <i>coves</i>, or tinkers.</p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>This, however, is by the way. Although it is
as well to make a note of the Indian extraction
of the English and other European gipsies, it is
not for this reason that they have been mentioned.
They find a place here for the sake of illustrating
what is meant by the <i>wandering tribes of India</i>,
whilst at the same time they throw a slight
illustration over the nature of <i>castes</i>. Lastly, they
are essentially parts of an ethnological investigation&mdash;ethnological
rather than either social or
political. Their characteristics are referable to a
difference of descent; and they are tinkers, wanderers,
poachers, and smugglers, not so much
because they are either gipsies, or Indians, as
because they are of a different stock from the
English. They are foreigners in the fullest sense
of the term; and they differ from their fellow-citizens
just as the Jew does&mdash;though less advantageously.</p>

<p>Now India swarms with the analogues of the
English gipsy; so much so as to make it likely
that the latter is found as far from his original
country as Wales and Norway, simply because
he is a vagabond, not because he is an Indian.</p>

<p>Of the chief of the tribes in question a good
account is given by Mr. Balfour. This list,
however, which is as follows, may be enlarged.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Gohur</i> are, perhaps, better known
under the name of <i>Lumbarri</i>, and better still as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the <i>Brinjarri</i>, the bullock-drivers of many parts of
India, but more especially of the Dekhan. They
are corn-merchants as well. Their organization
consists of divisions called <i>Tandas</i>, at the head
of which is a <i>Naek</i>. Two Naeks paramount over
the rest, reside permanently at Hyderabad, on
the confines of the Mahratta and Telugu countries.
The bullock, <i>Hatadia</i>, devoted to the God
<i>Balajee</i>, is an object of worship. In a long line
of Brinjarri met by Mr. Pickering,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> one of the
females was carrying a dog, which neither a
Hind&uacute; nor a Parsi would have done. Many of
them are Sikhs. There are, certainly, three divisions
of the Gohuri&mdash;the Chouhane,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the Rhatore,
and the Powar, and probably&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Purmans</i> are another branch of them; consisting
of about seventy-five families of agriculturists
on the Bombay islets.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Bhowri</i>, called also <i>Hirn-shikarri</i> and
<i>Hern-pardi</i>, though Bhowri is the native name,
are hunters. They also fall into subordinate
divisions.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Tarrem&uacute;ki</i>; so-called by themselves, but
known in the Dekhan as <i>Ghissaris</i>, or <i>Bail-Kumbar</i>,
and amongst the Mahrattas, as <i>Lohars</i>, are
blacksmiths.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>The Korawi</i>, fall in tribes which neither eat
with each other, nor intermarry, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The Bajantri, who are musicians.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The Teling&mdash;basket-makers and prostitutes.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The Kolla.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The Soli.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Bhattu</i>, <i>Dummur</i>, or <i>Kollati</i>, are exorcists
and exhibitors of feats of strength.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Muddikpur</i>, so called by themselves,
though known under several other names, follow
a variety of employments; some being ferrymen.</p>

<p>All these tribes wander about the country without
any permanent home, speak a peculiar dialect
with a considerable proportion of Non-Sanskritic
words, and preserve certain peculiarities of creed;
though in different degrees&mdash;the Muddikpur being
wholly or nearly pagan, the Tarrem&uacute;ki Brahminic.</p>

<p>The wandering life of these, and other similar
tribes is not, by itself, sufficient to justify us in
separating them from the other Hind&uacute;s. But it
does not stand alone. The fragments of an earlier
paganism, and the fragments of an earlier language
are phenomena which must be taken in
conjunction with it. These suggest the likelihood
of the Gohuri, the Bhatti, and their like, being
in the same category with the Khonds and Bhils,
&amp;c., <i>i.e.</i>, representatives of the earlier and more
exclusively Tamulian populations. If the gipsy
language of England had, instead of its Indian<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
elements, an equal number of words from the
original British, it would present the same phenomena,
and lead to the same inference as that
which is drawn from the Bhatti, Bhowri, Tarrem&uacute;ki,
and Gohuri vocabularies,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> <i>viz.</i>: the doctrine
that fragments of the original population
are to be sought for amongst the wanderers over
the face of the country, as well as among the
occupants of its mountain strongholds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a country like India, where differences of
habit, business, extraction, and creed, are accompanied
by an inordinate amount of separation
between different sections and subsections of its
population, and where slight barriers of diverse
kinds prevent intermixture, the different sects of
its numerous religions requires notice. This, however,
may be short. As sectarianism is generally
in the direct ratio to the complexity of the creed
submitted to section, we may expect to find the
forms of Brahminism and Buddhism, not less numerous
than those of either Christianity or Mahometanism.
And such is really the case. The sects
are too numerous to enlarge upon. The Sikh creed
has been noticed from its political importance.
That of the Jains is also remarkable, since it most
closely resembles Buddhism, without being absolutely<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Buddhist in the current sense of the word.
It is, possibly, the actual and original Buddhism
of the continent of India&mdash;supposed to
have been driven out bodily by Brahminism, but
really with the true vitality of persecuted creeds,
still surviving in disguise. Again, in India,
though in a less degree than in China, Philosophy
replaces belief&mdash;so much so, that the different
forms of one negation&mdash;Natural Religion&mdash;must
be classed amongst the creeds of Hindostan; by
the side of which there stand many kinds of
simple philosophy; just as was the case in ancient
Greece, where, in one and the same city, there
were the philosophers of the Academy and the
believers in Zeus.</p>

<p>There is, then, creed within creed in the two
great religions of India&mdash;to say nothing about the
numerous fragments of modified and unmodified
paganism.</p>

<p>And besides these there are the following introduced
religions&mdash;each coinciding, more or less,
with some ethnological division.</p>

<p>1. Christianity from, at least, four different
sources&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> That of the Christians of Thomas on the
Malabar Coast. Here the doctrine is that of the
Syrian Church, and the population being <i>perhaps</i> (?)
Persian in origin.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The Romanism of the French and Portuguese;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the latter having its greatest development
in the Mahratta country, about Goa.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Dutch and Danish Protestantism.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> English and American Protestantism. To
which add small infusions of the Armenian and
Abyssinian churches.</p>

<p>Of these it is only the Christians of St. Thomas
that are of much ethnological importance.</p>

<p>2. Judaism on the coast of Malabar; or the
Judaism of the so-called <i>Black Jews</i>.</p>

<p>3. Parseeism in Gujerat; of Persian origin,
and, probably, nearly confined to individuals of
Persian blood.</p>

<p>4. Mahometanism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of foreign blood there are numerous infusions.</p>

<p>1. <i>Arab.</i>&mdash;On the western coast, more especially
amongst the Moplahs of the neighbourhood of
Goa; where the stock seems to be Arabian on
the father's, and Indian on the mother's side.</p>

<p>2. <i>Persian.</i>&mdash;Amongst the Parsees and Saint
Thomas Christians (?); and, far more unequivocally,
and in greater proportions, amongst the
<i>Moghul</i> families&mdash;these being always more or less
Persian; but Persian with such heterogeneous intermixtures
of Turk and Mongol blood besides as
to make analysis almost impossible.</p>

<p>3. <i>Afghan.</i>&mdash;The Rohillas of Rohilcund are
Afghan in origin; so are the Patani&mdash;indeed, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
term <i>Patan</i> means an Afghan of Hindostan wherever
he may be.</p>

<p>4. <i>Jewish.</i></p>

<p>5, 6, 7.&mdash;<i>Chinese</i>, <i>Malay</i>, <i>Burmese</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. <i>European.</i></p>

<p>Of the <i>Indians out of India</i>, by far the most are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Gipsies</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Banians</i>, who are the Hind&uacute; traders of
Arabia, Persia, Cashmir, and other parts of the
East.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Hill Coolies</i>, individuals of the Khond
and K&uacute;li class, upon whom England is trying the
experiment of what may end in a revival of the
old crimping system, as a substitute for slave-labour
in our intertropical colonies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is a sketch of the ethnology of India; pre-eminently
complex, but not pre-eminently mysterious;
its chief problems being&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The general ethnological relations of the
Tamulian stock.</p>

<p>2. Those of the intrusive Brahminical Hind&uacute;s.</p>

<p>3. The relation of the intrusive population to
the aboriginal.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Our isolated and small settlements in the Malayan
Peninsula,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the dep&ocirc;t at Labuan, Sir James
Brooke's Rajahship of Sarawak, New Zealand,
the joint protectorate of the Sandwich Islands
and Tahiti, Australia, and Van Dieman's Land,
bring us to a new division of the human species,
which is conveniently called the <i>Oceanic</i>.</p>

<p>Its divisions and subdivisions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="smcap" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="tda" rowspan="3"><span style="font-size: 300%;">{</span></td><td>Protonesians</td><td class="tda" rowspan="3"><span style="font-size: 300%;">{</span></td><td>Micronesians</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td>Tasmanians.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Our settlements are limited to the Protonesian,
Proper Polynesian, Australian, and Tasmanian
sections: and we have no political authority over
any of the Malagasi, Micronesians, or Papuans.</p>

<p>With the exception of the occupants of the
Malayan Peninsula, all the Oceanic population
occupy islands. This explains the term <i>Oceanic</i>.</p>

<p>Their <i>distribution</i> is as remarkable as their <i>extension</i>.
The Amphinesian<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> stream of population,
originating in the peninsula of Malacca, is
continued through Borneo, the Moluccas, and the
Philippines, Lord North's Island, Sonsoral, the
Pelew group, the Caroline and Marianne Isles,
the Ralik and Radack chains, the Kingsmill
group and the Gilbert and Scarborough Islands,
to the Navigators', Society, Friendly, Marquesas,
Sandwich, and New Zealand groups; having become
<i>Micronesian</i> rather than <i>Protonesian</i>, after
passing the Philippines, and <i>Proper Polynesian</i>
rather than <i>Micronesian</i>, after passing the Scarborough
and Gilbert Archipelagoes. In this
course it passes <i>round</i> New Guinea and Australia;
in each of which islands the population is Kel&aelig;nonesian.</p>

<p>The Malay of the Malacca peninsula is no
longer either monosyllabic or uninflectional, although<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in immediate contact with the southern
dialects of the Siamese. Hence, the transition is
abrupt; although by no means conclusive as to
any broad and trenchant line of ethnological demarcation.</p>

<p>The differences of physical form are less than
those of language. No one has denied that the
Malay configuration is a modification of the Mongolian&mdash;<i>at
least in some of its varieties</i>.</p>

<p>I say <i>at least in some of its varieties</i>, because
within the narrow range of the Malaccan peninsula
and the island of Borneo we find no less
than three different types. In <i>Polynesia</i> one of
these, and in <i>Kel&aelig;nonesia</i> another becomes exaggerated&mdash;so
much so, as to suggest the idea of
a different origin for the populations.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Malays</i> are referable to the first type.
Mahometans in religion, they partake of the civilization
of the Arab and Indian, and differ but
slightly from the Indo-Chinese nations; the complexion
being dark and the hair straight. The
Mahometan Malays, however, are no true aborigines.
They are not only a new people on the
peninsula, but they consider themselves as such;
and those occupants which they recognize as older
than themselves, they call <i>Orang Binua</i>, or <i>men
of the soil</i>. Of these some have a darker complexion
and crisper hair than the intruding population:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and when we reach a particular section
called&mdash;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Semang</i>, we find them described as
having curly, crisp, matted, and even woolly hair,
thick lips, and a black skin. These, like most of
the other <i>Orang Binua</i>, are Pagans. Still their
language is essentially Malay; and their physical
conformation passes into that of the Malays by
numerous transitions.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Thirdly, we find in Borneo the <i>Dyaks</i>.
Many of these are as much fairer than the Malays
as the Semang are darker. Their language, however,
belongs to the Malay class; whilst their
religion and civilization may reasonably be supposed
to be that of the Malays previous to the
influences of Brahminism from India, Mahometanism
from Arabia, and the changes effected in
their habits, language, and appearance effected
thereby.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that within the peninsula
of Malaya, the Johore Archipelago, and the
island of Borneo, each of these types, and every
intermediate form as well, is to be found.</p>

<p><i>Malacca.</i>&mdash;The town of Malacca is a town of
Mahometan Malays, but I believe that the eastern
parts of Wellesley province are on the frontier of
the <i>Jokong</i>, <i>Jakon</i>, or <i>Jakun</i>. These are <i>Orang
Binua</i>, or aborigines&mdash;at least as compared with
the true Malays.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>In the eighth century&mdash;I am drawing an illustration
from the history of our own island, and its
relations to continental Germany&mdash;the Anglo-Saxons
of Great Britain, themselves originally
Pagan Germans, took an interest in the spiritual
welfare of the so-called Old Saxons, a tribe of
Westphalia, immediately related to their own
continental ancestors, these Old Saxons having
retained their primitive Paganism. The mission
partly succeeded, and partly failed.</p>

<p>Now, if in addition to this partial success of
the Anglo-Saxon mission, there had been a partial
Anglo-Saxon colonization as well, and if, side by
side with this, fragments of the old unmodified
Paganism had survived amongst the fens and
forests up to the present time, we should have had,
in the relations of England and Germany, precisely
what I imagine to have been the case with
the Malayan peninsula and the island of Sumatra.
Like Germany, the peninsula would have supplied
the original stock to the island; but, in the
island, that stock would have undergone certain
modifications. With these modifications it would&mdash;so
to say&mdash;have been <i>reflected</i> back upon the
continent&mdash;<i>re</i>-colonizing the old mother-country.
Now just what the Old Saxons of Westphalia
were to the Anglo-Saxons of the eighth century,
are the Jakun to the true Malays. They differ
from them in being something other than Mahometan;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, in being nearly what the Mahometan
Malays were before their conversion.</p>

<p>The Jakun are Malays, <i>minus</i> those points of
Malay civilization which are referable to the
religion of the Koran.</p>

<p>But the Jakun are only a few out of many; a
single branch of a great stem.</p>

<p>The most convenient term for the members in
general of this class is <i>Orang Binua</i>&mdash;a term
already explained.</p>

<p><i>The Biduanda Kallang.</i>&mdash;The next, then, of the
<i>Orang Binua</i> that comes in contact with a British
dependency&mdash;many others <i>not</i> thus politically
connected with us being passed over&mdash;are the
<i>Biduanda Kallang</i> of the parts about Sincapore.
Their present locality is the banks of the most
southern of the rivers of the peninsula, the Pulai.
Thither they were removed when the British took
possession of the island of Sincapore; of which
they were previously the joint occupants&mdash;joint
occupants, because they shared it with the tribe
which will be next mentioned. They were an
<i>Orang Laut</i> in one sense of the word, but not
in another. <i>Orang</i> means <i>men</i> or <i>people</i>, and <i>laut</i>
means <i>sea</i> in Malay; and the Biduanda Kallang
were boatmen rather than agriculturists. But
they were only freshwater sailors; since, though
they lived on the water, they avoided the open
sea. They formerly consisted of one hundred<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
families; but have been reduced by small-pox to
eight.</p>

<p>Their priest or physician is called <i>bomo</i>, and he
invokes the <i>hantu</i>, or deities, the <i>anito</i> of the
Philippine Islanders, the <i>tii</i> of the Tahitians;
and, probably, the <i>Wandong</i> and <i>Vintana</i> of Australia
and Madagascar respectively.</p>

<p>They bury their dead after wrapping the corpse
in a mat; and placing on the grave one cup of
woman's milk, one of water, and one of rice;
when they entreat the deceased to seek nothing
more from them.</p>

<p>Persons of even the remotest degree of relationship
are forbidden to intermarry.</p>

<p>The accounts of their physical appearance is
taken from too few individuals to justify any
generalization. Two, however, of them had the
forehead broader than the cheek-bones, so that the
head was pear-shaped. In a third, it was lozenge-shaped.
The head was small, and the face flat.
The lower jaw projected; but not the upper&mdash;so
that "when viewed in profile, the features seem
to be placed on a straight line, from which the prominent
parts rise very slightly."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><i>The Orang Sletar.</i>&mdash;The original joint-occupants
of Sincapore with the Biduanda Kallang,
were the <i>Orang Sletar</i>, or <i>men of the river Sletar</i>;
differing but little from the former. Of the two<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
families they are the shyer, and the more squalid;
numbering about two hundred individuals and
forty boats. Their dialect is Malay, spoken with
a guttural pronunciation, and with a clipping of
the words.</p>

<p>At the birth of a child they have no ceremonies;
at marriage a present of tobacco and rice to the
bride's mother confirms the match; at death the
deceased is wrapped in his garments and interred.</p>

<p>Skin diseases and deformities are common;
nevertheless, many of their women are given in
marriage to both the Malays and Chinese; but I
know of no account of the mixed progeny.</p>

<p>A low retreating forehead throws the face of
the <i>Orang Sletar</i> forwards, though the jaw is
rather perpendicular than projecting.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Such are the <i>Orang Binua</i> originally, or at
present, in contact with the small and isolated possessions
of the British in the Malayan peninsula.</p>

<p>Of the proper Malays I have said next to
nothing. Excellent works give full accounts of
them;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> whilst it is not through <i>them</i> that the true
ethnological problems are to be worked.</p>

<p>I believe that when we reach Borneo, the equivalents
to the <i>Orang Binua</i>, or the original populations<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in opposition to the Mahometan Malays,
become referable to a fresh type, and that instead
of being <i>darker</i> than the true Malays they are
often <i>lighter</i>. At any rate, one thing is certain,
<i>viz.</i>, that, whether the skin be brown, blackish, or
fair, the language belongs to the same stock.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;although in one area the darker tribes
may preponderate, it is not to the absolute exclusion
of the fairer. The Dyaks of Borneo
are, generally speaking, light-complexioned; yet,
there is special evidence to the existence of dark
tribes in that island. On the other hand there is
equal evidence to the existence of families lighter-skinned
than the true Malays in the peninsula.
Nevertheless, as a general rule, the departure from
the type of that population is towards darkness
of colour on the continent, and towards lightness
in Borneo.</p>

<p>With what physical conditions these differences
coincide is not always easy to be discerned. In
the South Sea Islands, where in one and the
same Archipelago, we find some tribes tall and
fair, whereas others are dark and ill-featured, it
has been remarked by Captain Beechy that this
contrast of complexion coincides with the geological
structure of the soil. The lower and more
coralline the island, the blacker the islanders;
the more elevated and volcanic, the lighter. In
Africa, it is the low alluvia of rivers that favour<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the Negro configuration. Mountains or table-lands,
on the other hand, give us red or yellow
skins, rather than sable.</p>

<p>The Dyaks, then, are light-coloured Pagans,
speaking languages allied to the Malay; little
touched by Arabic, and less by Hind&uacute; influences;
with manners and customs that, more or less,
re-appear amongst the Battas (or ruder tribes of
Sumatra), and the so-called Harafuras of Celebes&mdash;and
not only here but elsewhere. In other
words, in all the islands, where Indian and Arabic
civilization have not succeeded in wholly changing
the primitive character, analogues of the
<i>Orang Binua</i> are to be found; their greatest differences
being those of stature and complexion&mdash;differences
upon which good judges have laid
great stress; but differences which will probably
be found to coincide with certain geological conditions
in the way of physical, and with a lower
level of civilization in the way of moral causes&mdash;these
moral causes having indirectly a physical
action.</p>

<p>The Dyaks, in general, use the <i>sumpitan</i>,
or blow-pipe, about five feet long; out of
which some tribes shoot simple, others poisoned
arrows. The utmost distance that the sumpitan
carries is about one hundred yards. At twenty it
is sure in its aim. The differences between the
Dyak weapon, and one in use with the Arawaks<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of Guiana is but trifling&mdash;perhaps it amounts
to nothing at all.</p>

<p>Some Dyak tribes tattoo their bodies; others
do not.</p>

<p>Before a Dyak youth marries he must lay at
the feet of the bride-elect the head of an enemy.
This makes <i>head-hunting</i> a normal item of Dyak
courtship.</p>

<p>Traces of the Indian mythology&mdash;measures of
the Indian influence in other respects&mdash;just exist
amongst the Dyaks&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Battara</i> is a name in
their Pantheon, and this is an alteration of the
Brahminic <i>Avatar</i>.</p>

<p>The pirates who harass the coasts of Borneo
and the Chinese Seas&mdash;destined, at some future
time to be, like the Kaffres, but too well-known
to the English tax-payers&mdash;are Malays rather
than <i>Orang Binua</i>, or their equivalents; the
navigation of the Dyaks being chiefly confined to
rivers.</p>

<p>The particular tribes of Sarawak are the following&mdash;the
Lundu, the Sarambo, the Sing&eacute;,
the Suntah, the Sow, and the Sibnow. It is
almost unnecessary to name the great fountain-head
for all our recent knowledge of Borneo&mdash;Sir
James Brooke.</p>

<p>The Dyak type predominates amongst the
<i>Orang Binua</i> of Borneo. In the Philippines the
Semang complexion re-appears. But the prolongation<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of the eastward line of migration takes us
through the Mariannes and Ladrones to Polynesia;
and here the magnitude of the islands decreases;
in other words, the influences of the sea-air
become greater. The aliment becomes almost
wholly vegetable. The separation from the civilizational
influences of Asia amounts to absolute
isolation. Of the general ethnology of the South
Sea Islanders I say nothing. The reasons which
took me over China, Arabia, and the Malayan
peninsula, <i>sicco pede</i>, spare the necessity of details
here.</p>

<p>In the Sandwich Islands there is a constitution.
In Tahiti, a school of native Christian Missionaries.</p>

<p>New Zealand exhibits the contrast between
the darker and lighter-coloured Oceanic populations
in so remarkable a manner as to have engendered
the notion that two stocks occupy the
island. If it were so, the fact would be remarkable
and mysterious. How <i>one</i> population found
its way to a locality so distant is by no means an
easy question; whilst the assumption of a second
family of immigrants just doubles its difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Java the proper Malay influences have been<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
so great as to leave but few traces of the <i>Orang
Binua</i>; and, earlier even than these, those of
India were actively at work.</p>

<p>East of Bali, however, the <i>Orang Binua</i> re-appear,
and here the type is that of the Semangs.
From Ombay, parts of Ende, and parts of Sumbawa,
we have short vocabularies&mdash;short, but not
too scanty to set aside the hasty, but accredited,
assertion of the Australian language, having
nothing in common with those of the Indian
Archipelago.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>I feel as satisfied that Australia was peopled
from either Timor or Rotti, as I do about the
Gallic origin of the ancient Britons.</p>

<p>I believe this because the geographical positions
of the countries suggest it.</p>

<p>I believe it, because the older and more aboriginal
populations of Timor and Rotti approach,
in physical character, the Australian.</p>

<p>I believe it, because the proportion of words
in the vocabularies alluded to is greater than can
be attributed to accident; whilst the words themselves
are not of that kind which is introduced by
intercourse. Besides which, no such intercourse
either occurs at the present moment, or can be
shown to have ever existed.</p>

<p>Australia agrees with parts of Africa, South<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
America, and Polynesia, in being partially
intertropical and wholly south of the equator&mdash;no
part of continental Asia or Europe coming
under these conditions. But it differs
from Polynesia in being continental rather than
insular in climate; from South America in the
absence of great rivers and vast alluvial tracts;
and from Africa in being wholly isolated from the
Northern Hemisphere. It is with South Africa,
however, that its closest analogies exist. Both
have but small water-systems; both vast tracts of
elevated barren country; and both a distinctive
vegetation. The animal kingdoms, however, of
the two areas have next to nothing in common.
The comparative non-existence of Australian
mammalia, higher in rank than the marsupials,
is a subject for the zoologist. Ethnology only
indicates its bearing upon the sustenance of man.
Poor in the vegetable elements of food, and
beggarly in respect to the animal, the vast continental
expanse of Australia supports the scantiest
aboriginal population of the world, and nourishes
it worst. The steppes of Asia feed the horse;
the <i>tundras</i>, the reindeer; the circumpolar icebergs,
the seal; and each of these comparatively
inhospitable tracts is more kindly towards its
Mongolian, its Samoeid, and its Eskimo occupant,
than Australia with its intertropical climate, but
wide and isolated deserts.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Except that his hair (which is often either
straight, or only crisp or wavy) has not attained
its <i>maximum</i> of frizziness, and has seldom or
never been called <i>woolly</i>, the Australian is a
Semang under a South African climate, on a
South African soil, and with more than a South
African isolation.</p>

<p>Few Australians count as far as five, and fewer
still beyond it. This paucity of numerals is
South American as well&mdash;the Brazilian and Carib,
and other systems of numeration being equally
limited.</p>

<p>The sound of <i>s</i> is wanting in the majority of
Australian languages. So it is in many of the
Polynesian.</p>

<p>The social constitution is of extreme simplicity.
Many degrees removed from the industrial, almost
as far from the agricultural state, the Australian
is hardly even a hunter&mdash;except so far as the
kangaroo or wombat are beasts of chase. Families&mdash;scarcely
large enough to be called tribes
or clans&mdash;wander over wide but allotted areas.
Nowhere is the approach to an organized polity
so imperfect.</p>

<p>This makes the differences between section and
section of the Australian population, both broad
and numerous. Nevertheless, the fundamental
unity of the whole is not only generally admitted,
but&mdash;what is better&mdash;it has been well illustrated.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The researches of Captain Grey, Teichelmann,
Schurrmann, and others, have chiefly contributed
to this.</p>

<p>The appreciation of certain apparent characteristic
peculiarities has been less satisfactory;
differences having been over-rated and points of
similarity wondered at rather than investigated.</p>

<p>The well-known instrument called the <i>boomerang</i>
is Australian, and it is, perhaps, exclusively
so.</p>

<p>Circumcision is an Australian practice&mdash;a practice
common to certain Polynesians and Negroes,
besides&mdash;to say nothing of the Jews and Mahometans.</p>

<p>The recognition of the <i>maternal</i> rather than
the <i>paternal</i> descent is Australian. Children
take the name of their mother. What other
points it has in common with the Malabar polyandria
has yet to be ascertained.</p>

<p>When an Australian dies, those words which
are identical with his name, or (in case of compounds)
with any part of it, cease to be used;
and some synonym is adopted instead; just as if,
in England, whenever a Mr. <i>Smith</i> departed this
life, the parish to which he belonged should cease
to talk of <i>blacksmiths</i>, and say <i>forgemen</i>, <i>forgers</i>,
or something equally respectful to the deceased,
instead. This custom re-appears in Polynesia,
and in South America; Dobrizhoffer's account of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the Abiponian custom being as follows:&mdash;The
"Abiponian language is involved in new difficulties
by a ridiculous custom which the savages
have of continually abolishing words common to
the whole nation, and substituting new ones in
their stead. Funeral rites are the origin of this
custom. The Abipones do not like that anything
should remain to remind them of the dead.
Hence appellative words bearing any affinity with
the names of the deceased are presently abolished.
During the first years that I spent
amongst the Abipones, it was usual to say
<i>Hegmalkam kaham&aacute;tek</i>, when will there be
a slaughtering of oxen? On account of the
death of some Abipon, the word <i>Kaham&aacute;tek</i>
was interdicted, and, in its stead, they were all
commanded by the voice of a crier to say, <i>Hegmalkam
n&eacute;gerkat&agrave;?</i> The word <i>nihirenak</i>, a tiger,
was exchanged for <i>apanigehak</i>; <i>pe&ucirc;</i>, a crocodile,
for <i>Kaeprhak</i>, and <i>Ka&aacute;ma</i>, Spaniards, for <i>Rikil</i>,
because these words bore some resemblance to the
names of Abipones lately deceased. Hence it is
that our vocabularies are so full of blots occasioned
by our having such frequent occasions to
obliterate interdicted words, and insert new
ones."</p>

<p>The following custom is Australian, and it
belongs to a class which should always be noticed
when found. This is because it appears and re-appears<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in numerous parts of the world, in different
forms, and, apparently, independent of
ethnological affinities.</p>

<p>A family selects some natural object as its
symbol, badge, or armorial bearing.</p>

<p>All natural objects of the same class then
become sacred; <i>i.e.</i>, the family which has adopted,
respects them also.</p>

<p>The modes of showing this respect are various.
If the object be an animal, it is not killed; if a
plant, not plucked.</p>

<p>The native term for the object thus chosen is
<i>Kobong</i>.</p>

<p>A man cannot marry a woman of the same
<i>Kobong</i>.</p>

<p>Until we know the sequence of the cause and
effect in the case of the Australian <i>Kobong</i>, we
have but little room for speculation as to its
origin. Is the plant or animal adopted by a particular
family selected because it was previously
viewed with a mysterious awe, or is it invested
with the attributes of sacro-sanctity because it
has been chosen by the family? This has yet to
be investigated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Captain Gray truly remarks, the
Australian <i>Kobong</i> has elements in common with
the Polynesian <i>tabu</i>! Might he not have added
that the <i>names</i> are probably the same? The
change from <i>t</i> to <i>k</i>, and the difference between a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
nasal and a vowel termination, are by no means
insuperable objections.</p>

<p>He also adds that it has a counterpart with the
American system of <i>totem</i>; although the exact
degree to which the comparison runs on all fours
is undetermined.</p>

<p>But the disuse of certain words on the death of
kinsmen, and the <i>Kobong</i> are not the only customs
common to the Australian and American.</p>

<p>The admission to the duties and privileges of
manhood is preceded by a probation. What this
is in the Mandan tribe of the Sioux Americans,
and the extent to which it consists in the infliction
and endurance of revolting and almost incredible
cruelties, may be seen in Mr. Catlin's
description&mdash;the description of an eye-witness.
In Australia it is the <i>Babu</i> that cries for the
youths that have arrived at puberty. Suddenly,
and at night, a cry is heard in the woods. Upon
hearing this, the men of the neighbourhood take
the youths to a secluded spot previously fixed
upon. The ceremony then takes place. Sham
fights, dances, partial mutilations of the body,
<i>e.g.</i>, the knocking out of a front tooth, are elements
of it. And this is as much as is known of
it; except that from the time of initiation to the
time of marriage, the young men are forbidden to
speak to, or even approach a female.</p>

<p>Surely, it is the common conditions of a hunter<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
life which determine these probationary preparations
for the hardships which accompany it in
populations so remote as the Australian and the
American of the prairie. I say of the prairie,
because we shall find that in the proportion as
the agricultural state replaces the erratic habits of
the hunter, ceremonies of the sort in question
decrease both in number and peculiarity of character.</p>

<p>A third regulation forbids the use of the more
enviable articles of diet, like fish, eggs, the emu,
and the choicer sorts of opossum and kangaroo
to the Australian youth.</p>

<p>All that is known of the Australian religion is
due to the researches of the United States Exploring
Expedition. The most specific fact in
this respect is the name <i>Wandong</i> as applied to the
evil spirit. I believe this to be truly a word
belonging to the Oceanic Pantheon in general,
and&mdash;as stated above&mdash;to be the same as <i>Vintana</i>
in Malagasi, and as the root <i>anit</i> in many of the
Polynesian languages.</p>

<p><i>The Tasmanians.</i>&mdash;A few families, the remains
of the aborigines of Van Dieman's Land, occupy
Flinder's Island, whither they have been removed.</p>

<p>I can give but little information concerning
them.</p>

<p>From the Australians they differ but slightly
in mental capacity, and civilizational development.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Perhaps their very low level in this respect is the
lower of the two.</p>

<p>The language seems to have fallen into not less
than four mutually unintelligible forms of speech.</p>

<p>Their <i>hair</i> constituted their chief physical difference.
This was curled, frizzy, or mopped.</p>

<p>The <i>a priori</i> view of their origin is that they
crossed Torres Straits from Australia. I have,
however, stated elsewhere that a case may be
made out for either Timor or New Caledonia
being their mother countries; in which case the
stream of population has gone <i>round</i> Australia
rather than <i>across</i> it. Certain peculiarities of the
Tasmanian language give us the ground for thus
demurring to the <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> view of their descent.
The same help us to account for the differences in
texture of the hair.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<h3>DEPENDENCIES IN AMERICA.</h3>

OF ST. VINCENT.&mdash;TRINIDAD.</p></div>

<p><i>The Athabaskans.</i>&mdash;The best starting-point for
the ethnology of the British dependencies in
America is the water-system of the largest of the
rivers which empty themselves into the Polar
Sea, a system which comprises the Rivers Peel,
Dahodinni, and the Rivi&egrave;re aux Liards, tributaries
to the McKenzie, as well as the Great Bear
Lake, the Great Slave Lake, and Lake Athabaska;
a vast tract, and one which is <i>almost</i> wholly
occupied by a population belonging to one and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the same class; a class sometimes known under
the name <i>Chepewyan</i>, or <i>Chepeyan</i>, sometimes
under that of <i>Athabaskan</i>.</p>

<p>The water-system in question forms the centre
of the great Athabaskan area&mdash;the centre, but not
the whole. <i>Eastward</i>, there are Athabaskan tribes
as far as the coasts of Hudson's Bay; westwards
as far as the immediate neighbourhood of the
Pacific; and southwards as far as the head-waters
of the Saskatchewan. Full nineteen-twentieths
of the Athabaskan population, in respect to its
political relations, is British; all that is not British
being either Russian or American. To this
we may add, that it is the Hudson's Bay territory
rather than Canada to which the British Athabaskans
belong.</p>

<p>The divisions and subdivisions of the Athabaskans
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>S&iacute;-&iacute;saw-dinni</i> (<i>See-eesaw-dinneh</i>), or
<i>rising-sun-men</i>.&mdash;These, generally called either
<i>Chipewyans</i>, or <i>Northern Indians</i>, are the most
eastern members of the family, and extend from
the mouth of the Churchill River to Lake Athabaska.
I imagine that the <i>Brushwood</i>, <i>Birchrind</i>,
and <i>Sheep</i> Indians are particular divisions of
this branch.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Beaver Indians.</i>&mdash;From the Lake Athabaska
to the Rocky Mountain, <i>i.e.</i>, the valley of
the Peace River.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The <i>Daho-dinni</i>.&mdash;On the head-waters of the
Rivi&egrave;re aux Liards. Called also <i>Mauvais Monde</i>.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Strong-Bows</i>.&mdash;Mountaineers of the
upper part of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Kancho</i>.&mdash;Called also <i>Hare</i> and <i>Slave</i>
Indians. Starved and miserable occupants of the
parts along the River McKenzie between the
Slave and Great Bear Lakes. Accused of occasional
cannibalism, justified by the pressure of
famine. Due east of these come&mdash;</p>

<p>6. The <i>Dog-ribs</i>, and</p>

<p>7. The <i>Yellow-knives</i>, on the <i>Copper River</i>;
these last being also called the Copper Indians.</p>

<p>8, 9. The <i>Slaous-cud-dinni</i><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of the McKenzie
River is, probably, a division of some of the
other groups rather than a separate substantive
class.</p>

<p>10. The <i>Takulli</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;These fall into eleven minor
tribes or clans.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Ta&uacute;-tin</i>; probably the same as the
<i>Naote-tains</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Tshilko-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Nasko-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The <i>Thetlio-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The <i>Tsatsno-tin</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p><i>f.</i> The <i>Nula&aacute;u-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> The <i>Ntsa&aacute;u-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> The <i>Natli&aacute;u-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> The <i>Nikozli&aacute;u-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> The <i>Tatshi&aacute;u-tin</i>.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> The <i>Babine</i> Indians.</p>

<p>11. The <i>Susi</i> (<i>Sussees</i>).&mdash;On the head-waters
of the Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>New Caledonia is the chief area of the <i>Takulli</i>.</p>

<p>Adjacent to them, but to the east of the Rocky
Mountains, lie&mdash;</p>

<p>12. The <i>Tsikani</i> (<i>Sicunnies</i>).</p>

<p>The Athabaskan is the <i>first</i> class in our list;
and, if we look only at the area which its population
occupies, it is a great one. All the Athabaskan
languages or dialects are mutually intelligible.</p>

<p><i>The Algonkins.</i>&mdash;The <i>second</i> class is the Algonkin.
It is greater in every way than the Athabaskan&mdash;greater
in respect to the number of its
divisions and subdivisions, greater in respect to
the ground it covers, and greater in respect to
the range of difference which it embraces. All
the Algonkin languages are not mutually intelligible.</p>

<p>Unlike the Athabaskan the Algonkin stock is
nearly equally divided between the United States
and Great Britain.</p>

<p>Unlike, too, the Athabaskan, it is divided<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
between the Canadas and our other possessions
and the Hudson's Bay territory.</p>

<p>The whole of the Canadas, with one small but
important exception, the whole of New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and Prince
Edward's Isle, is Algonkin. Labrador and Newfoundland
are chiefly Algonkin.</p>

<p>To this stock belonged and belong the extinct
and extant Indians of New England, part of New
York, part of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, part of the Carolinas, and part of even
Kentucky and Tennessee; a point of American
rather than of British ethnology, but a point
necessary to be noted for the sake of duly appreciating
the magnitude of this stock.</p>

<p>Amongst others, the Pequods, the Mohicans,
the Narragansetts, the Massachuset, the Montaug,
the Delaware, the Menomini, the Sauks,
the Ottogamis, the Kikkap&uacute;s, the Potawhotamis,
the Illinois, the Miami, the Piankeshaws,
the Shawnos, &amp;c. belong to this stock&mdash;all
within the United States.</p>

<p>The British Algonkins are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Crees</i>; of which the <i>Skoffi</i> and <i>Sheshatap&uacute;sh</i>
of Labrador are branches.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Ojibways</i>;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> falling into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Ojibways Proper</i>, of which the <i>Sauteurs</i>
are a section.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Ottawas</i> of the River Ottawa.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The original Indians of Lake <i>Nipissing</i>; important
because it is believed that the form of
speech called <i>Algonkin</i>, a term since extended to
the whole class, was their particular dialect.
They are now either extinct or amalgamated with
other tribes.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The <i>Messisaugis</i>, to the north of Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Micmacs</i> of New Brunswick, Gasp&eacute;,
Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and part of Newfoundland;
closely allied to the&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>Abnaki</i> of Mayne, and the British frontier;
represented at present by the <i>St. John's Indians</i>.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Bethuck</i>&mdash;the aborigines of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Blackfoots</i>, consisting of the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Satsikaa</i>, or <i>Blackfoots Proper</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Kena</i>, or <i>Blood Indians</i>.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Piegan</i>.</p>

<p>To these must be added numerous extinct
tribes.</p>

<p><i>The Iroquois.</i>&mdash;The single and important exception
to the Algonkin population of the Canadas
is made by the existence of certain members of
the great Iroquois class on the New York frontier;
a class falling into two divisions. The
<i>northern</i> Iroquois belong to New York and Pennsylvania,
the <i>southern</i> to the Carolinas.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The former of these two falls into two great confederations,
and into several unconfederate tribes.</p>

<p>The chief of the unconfederate tribes are the
now extinct <i>Mynkasar</i> and <i>Cochnowagoes</i>&mdash;extinct,
unless either or both be represented by a
small remnant mentioned by Schoolcraft, in his
great work on the Indian tribes, now in the course
of publication, under the sanction of Congress,
as the <i>St. Regis Indians</i>.</p>

<p>Of the second confederation the leading members
were the <i>Wyandots</i>, or <i>Hurons</i>, of the parts
between Lakes Simcoe, Huron, and Erie.</p>

<p>The first was that of the famous and formidable
<i>Mohawks</i>. To these add the <i>Senekas</i>, the <i>Onondagos</i>,
the <i>Cayugas</i>, and the <i>Oneidas</i>, and you
have the <i>Five</i> Nations. Then add, as a later
accession, from the southern Iroquois, the <i>Tuskaroras</i>,
and the <i>Six</i> Nations are formed.</p>

<p>Between these two there was war <i>even to the
knife</i>; the greater portion of the Wyandot league
belonging to the Algonkin class.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a few representatives of the
whole seven tribes<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> still remain extant, their
present locality&mdash;a reserve&mdash;being the triangular
peninsula which was the original Huron area.</p>

<p>Again, in the present site of Montreal, the earlier
occupants were the <i>Hochelaga</i>; an Iroquois tribe
also.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Sioux.</i>&mdash;In tracing the Nelson River from
its embouchure in Hudson's Bay, towards its
source in the Rocky Mountains, we reach Lake
Winnepeg, and the Red River Settlement&mdash;the
Red River rising within the boundary of the
United States, flowing from south to north, and
receiving, as a feeder, the Assineboin. Now the
Valley of the Assineboin is an interesting ethnological
locality.</p>

<p>Either the river takes its name from the population,
or the population from the river; the
division to which it belongs being a new one.
Different from the Algonkins on the east, different
from the Athabaskans on the north, and (in
the present state of our knowledge) different from
the Arrapahoes on the west, the Assineboins
have all their affinities southwards. In that
direction the family to which they belong extends
as far as Louisiana. These Indians it is to whom
nine-tenths of the Valley of Missouri originally
belonged&mdash;the Indians of the great Sioux class;
Indians whose original hunting-grounds included
the vast prairie-country from the Rocky Mountains
to the Mississippi, and who again appear as
an isolated detachment on Lake Michigan. These
isolated Sioux are the Winebagoes; the others
being the Dahcota, the Yankton, the Teton, the
Upsaroka, the Mandan, the Minetari, the Missouri,
the Osage, the Konzas, the Ottos, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Omahaws, the Puncas, the Ioways, and the
Quappas,&mdash;all American, <i>i.e.</i>, belonging to the
United States.</p>

<p>None of the Sioux tribe come in contact with
the sea. None of them belong to the great <i>forest</i>
districts of America. Most of them hunt over
the country of the buffalo. This makes them
warlike, migratory hunters; with fewer approaches
to agricultural or industrial civilization than any
Indians equally favoured by soil and climate.</p>

<p>Of this class the Assineboins are the British
representatives. They are the chief <i>Red River</i>
aborigines.</p>

<p>It is the Iroquois, the Sioux, and certain members
of the Algonkin stock, upon which the current
and popular notions of the American Indian, the
<i>Red Man</i>, as he is called&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<span class="i0">The Stoic of the woods, the man without a tear, &amp;c.,<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">have been formed. The Athabaskans, on the
other hand, have not contributed much to our
notions on this point. In the first place, they
are less known; in the next, they are less typical.</p>

<p>But this raises their value in the eyes of the
ethnologist; and the very fact of their possessing
certain characteristics, in a comparatively slight
degree, makes them all the fitter for illustrating
the phenomena of <i>transition</i>.</p>

<p>Previous, however, to this, we must get our<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
other <i>extreme</i>. This is to be found in the ethnology
of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Eskimo.</i>&mdash;It is a very easy matter for an
artistic ethnologist to make some fine light-and-shade
contrasts between two populations, where
he has an Iroquois or a Sioux at one end, and an
Eskimo of Labrador at the other. An oblique
eye, bleared and sore from the glare of the snow,
with a crescentic fold overshadowing the <i>caruncula
lacrymalis</i>, surmounted by a low forehead and
black shaggy locks, with cheek-bones of such
inordinate development as to make the face as
broad as it is long, are elements of ugliness which
catch the imagination, and produce a caricature,
where we want a picture. And they are elements
of ugliness which can be accumulated. We may
add to them, a nose so flat, and cheeks so fleshy,
as for a ruler, placed across the latter, to leave the
former untouched. We may then notice the state
of the teeth, from the mastication of injurious
substances; and having thus exhausted nature,
we may revert to the deformities of art. We
may observe that wherever there is a fleshy portion
of the face that can be perforated by a stone knife,
or pierced by a whalebone, there will be tattooing
and incisions; and that wherever there are incisions,
bones, nails, feathers, and such like ornaments
will be inserted. All this is the case.
What European ladies do with their ears, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Eskimo does with the cartilage of his nose, the
lips, the corners of his mouth, and the cheeks.
More than this&mdash;in the lower lip, parallel to the
mouth, and taking the guise of a mouth additional,
a slit is made quite through the lip, large enough
to allow the escape of spittle and the protrusion
of the tongue. The insertion of a shell or bone,
cut into the shape of teeth, completes the adornment.</p>

<p>Then comes the question of colour. The Indian
has a tinge of red; a tinge which enables us to
compare his skin to <i>copper</i>. The Eskimo is simply
brown, swarthy, or tawny.</p>

<p>Again, the Eskimo hold periodical fairs. Whales
are scarce in the south, and wood in the north of
Greenland; and in consequence of this, there are
regular meetings for the business of barter. This
gives us the elements of commercial industry;
elements which must themselves be taken in conjunction
with the maritime habits of the people.
What stronger contrast can we find to all this than
the gloomy isolation of the hunters of the prairie-countries,
whether Sioux, Iroquois, or Algonkin?</p>

<p>Again, it is safe, in the way of intellectual
capacity, to give the Eskimo credit for ingenuity
and imitativeness. The Indian, of the type which
we have chosen to judge him by, is pre-eminently
indocile and inflexible.</p>

<p>Yet all this, with much more besides, is capable<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of great qualification&mdash;qualification which we find
necessary, whether we look to the extent to which
the Eskimos approach the Indian, or the Indian
the Eskimo&mdash;each receding from its own more
extreme representative.</p>

<p>The prominence of the nasal bones is certainly
common amongst the Red Indian tribes; and
rare amongst the Eskimo. Yet it is neither
universal in the one, nor non-existent in the other.
Oval features, a mixture of red in the complexion,
an aquiline nose, have all been observed amongst
the more favoured of the Circumpolar men and
women.</p>

<p>In respect, too, to stature, the Eskimo is less
remarkable for inferiority than is generally supposed.
His bulky, baggy dress makes him look
square and short. Measurements, however, correct
this impression. Men of the height of five
feet ten inches have been noticed as particular
specimens&mdash;better grown individuals than their
fellows. And men under five feet have also been
noticed for the contrary reasons. Numerous measurements,
however, give about five feet as the
height of an Eskimo woman, and five feet six
inches as that of a man. This is more than so
good an authority as Mr. Crawfurd gives to the
Malays; whose person is squat, and whose average
stature does not exceed five feet three or four
inches. It is more, too, than Sir R. Schomburgk<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
gives the Guiana Indians, as may be seen from
the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">It is more than the average of several other
populations.</p>

<p>Neither is the Eskimo skull so wholly different
from the American. It is, probably, larger in its
dimensions; so that its cavity contains more cubic
inches. The measurements, however, which suggest
this view, are but few. On the other hand,
the relations between the <i>width</i> and the <i>depth</i>
of the skull, are considered important and distinctive.</p>

<p>By <i>width</i> is meant the number of inches from
side to side, from one parietal bone to the other;
in other words, the <i>parietal diameter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Depth</i> signifies the length of the <i>occipito-frontal</i>
diameter, or the number of inches from the forehead
to the back of the skull.</p>

<p>Now, in one out of four of the Eskimo
crania examined by Dr. Morton, the parietal diameter
so nearly approaches the occipito-frontal
as for the skull in question to be as much as
5&middot;4 inches in width, and as little as 5&middot;7 in depth;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a measurement which makes the Eskimo brain
almost as broad as it is long. <i>Valeat quantum.</i>
It is an extreme specimen. The remainder are
as 5&middot;5 to 7&middot;3; as 5&middot;1 to 7&middot;5; and as 5 to 6&middot;7,
proportions by no means exclusively Eskimo,
and proportions which occur in very many of the
undeniably American stocks.</p>

<p>Likeness there is; and variety there is;&mdash;likeness
in physical feature, likeness in language, and
likeness in the general moral and intellectual
characteristics. And then there is variety&mdash;variety
in all the details of their arts; variety in their
bows, their canoes, their dwellings, their fashions
in the way of incisions and tattooings, and their
fashions in the dressing of their hair.</p>

<p>This is as much as can be said about the Eskimo
at present. It is, however, preparatory to the
general statement that <i>all the remaining</i> Indians of
British North America recede from the Sioux and
Iroquois type, and approach that of the family in
question. Such, indeed, has been the case, though
(perhaps) in a less degree, with one of the classes
already considered&mdash;the Athabaskan.</p>

<p><i>The Kol&uacute;ch.</i>&mdash;The extreme west of the British
possessions beyond the Rocky Mountains, <i>north</i>
of latitude 55&deg; is but imperfectly known. Indeed,
for scientific, and, perhaps, for political
purposes as well, the country is unfortunately
divided. The Russians have the long but narrow<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
strip of coast; and, consequently, limit their investigations
to its bays and archipelagoes. The
British, on the contrary, though they possess the
interior, have no great interest in the parts about
the Russian boundary. In the way of trade,
they are not sufficiently on the sea for the sea-otter,
nor near enough the mountains for other
fur-bearing animals.</p>

<p>Now, the mouth of the Stikin River is Russian,
the head-waters British. Beyond these, we
have the water-system of the McKenzie&mdash;for
that river, although falling into the Arctic Sea,
has a western fork, which breaks through the
barrier of the Rocky Mountains, and changes in
direction from west and south-west to north. Lake
Simpson, Lake Dease, and the River Turnagain
belong to this branch; the tract in which they lie
being a range of highlands, if not of mountains.</p>

<p>This is the country of the Nehannis; conterminous
on the south with that of the Takulli, and
on the north-east with that of the Dahodinni.
How far, however, it extends towards the Russian
boundary and in the north-west direction I
cannot say.</p>

<p>The Nehannis are, probably, the chief British
representatives of the class called Kol&uacute;ch.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Assuming this&mdash;although from the want of a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
special Nehanni vocabulary, the philological evidence
is wanting&mdash;I begin with the notice of the
<i>Nehannis</i>, as known to the Hudson's Bay Company,
and afterwards superadd a sketch of the
<i>Sitkans</i>, as known to the Russians of New Archangel;
the two notices together giving us the
special description of a family, and the general
view of the class to which that family belongs.</p>

<p>That the Nehannis are brave, warlike, and turbulent,
is no more than is expected. We are
far beyond the latitude of the peaceful Eskimo.
That they are ruled by a woman should surprise
us. Such, however, is the case. A female rules
them&mdash;and rules them, too, with a rod of iron.
Respect for sex has here attained its height. It
had begun to be recognized amongst the Athabaskans.</p>

<p>The Nehannis are strong enough to rob; but
they are also civilized enough to barter; buying
of the inland tribes, and selling to the Russians&mdash;a
practice which seems to divert the furs of British
territory to the markets of Muscovy. But this is
no business of the ethnologist's. They are slavers
and slave-owners; ingenious and imitative; fond
of music and dancing; fish-eaters; active in body;
bold and treacherous in temper; and with the
common Kol&uacute;ch physiognomy and habits.</p>

<p><i>These</i> we must collect from the descriptions of
the Russian Kol&uacute;ches&mdash;the locality where they<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
have been best studied being Sitka Sound, or
New Archangel. We must do it, however, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, remembering that the Sitkans
are Kol&uacute;ch of an Archipelago, the Nehanni Kol&uacute;ch
of a continent.</p>

<p>The Kol&uacute;ch complexion is light; the hair long
and lank; the eyes black; and the lip and chin
often bearded.</p>

<p>The <i>Kon&aelig;gi</i> are the natives of the island
Kadiak. Now Lisiansky, from whom the chief
details of the Sitkan Kol&uacute;ch are taken, especially
states that, with few exceptions, their
manners and customs are those of these same
Kon&aelig;gi; one of the minor points of difference
being the greater liveliness of the Sitkans, and
one of the more important ones, their treatment
of the dead. They <i>burn</i> the bodies (as do the
Takulli Athabaskans) and deposit the ashes in
wooden boxes placed upon pillars, painted or
carved, more or less elaborately, according to the
wealth of the deceased.</p>

<p>On the death of a <i>toyon</i>, or chief, one of his
slaves is killed and burned with him. If, however,
the deceased be of inferior rank the victim
is <i>buried</i>. If the death be in battle, the head,
instead of being burned, is kept in a wooden box
of its own. But it is not with the shaman as with
the warrior. The shaman is merely interred;
since he is supposed to be too full of the evil<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
spirit to be consumed by fire. The reason why
burning is preferred to burying is because the
possession of a piece of flesh is supposed to
enable its owner to do what mischief he pleases.</p>

<p><i>Now the Kon&aelig;gi are admitted Eskimo.</i></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the similarity between the
Sitkans and Kon&aelig;gi there is no want of true
American customs amongst them. Cruelty to
prisoners, indifference to pain when inflicted on
themselves, and the habit of scalping are common
to the Indians of King George's Archipelago, and
those of the water-system of the Mississippi. On
the other hand, they share the skill in painting
and carving with the Chen&uacute;ks and the aborigines
of the Oregon.</p>

<p><i>The Digothi.</i>&mdash;The Dahodinni are Athabaskan
rather than Kol&uacute;ch; the Nehanni Kol&uacute;ch rather
than Athabaskan. Now I imagine that the Dahodinni
country is partially encircled by Kol&uacute;ch
populations, and that a fresh branch of this stock
re-appears when we proceed northwards. On the
Lower McKenzie, in the valley of the Peel River,
and at the termination of the great Rocky Range
on the shore of the Polar Sea, we find the <i>Digothi</i>
or <i>Loucheux</i>; the only family not belonging to the
Eskimo class, which comes in contact with the
ocean; and, consequently, the only unequivocally
Indian population which interrupts the continuity
of the Eskimo from Behring's Straits to the Atlantic.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Perhaps the alluvium of a great river like the
McKenzie, has determined this displacement.
Such an occupancy would be as naturally coveted
by an inland population, as undervalued by a
maritime one. At any rate, the Loucheux have
the appearance of being an encroaching tenantry;
indeed, few Indians have had their physical appearance
described in terms equally favourable.
Black-haired and fair-complexioned, with fine
sparkling eyes, and regular teeth, they approach
the Nehanni in physiognomy, and surpass them
in stature. The same authority which expressly
states that the Nehanni are not generally tall,
speaks to the athletic proportions and tall stature
of the Loucheux; adding that their countenances
are handsome and expressive.</p>

<p>Whence came they? From the south-east, from
Russian America. Their points of contrast to the
Eskimo indicate this. Their points of contrast
to the Athabaskans indicate it also. Their points
of similarity to the Kol&uacute;ch do more. The Loucheux
possessive pronoun is the same as the
Kenay. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Fuller descriptions, however, of both the Loucheux
and Nehanni are required before we can
decidedly pronounce them to be Kol&uacute;ch; indeed,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
so high an authority as Gallatin places the latter
amongst the Athabaskans.</p>

<p><i>The Fall Indians.</i>&mdash;In a MS. communicated by
Mr. Gallatin to Dr. Prichard, and, by the latter
kindly lent to myself, and examined by me some
years back, was a vocabulary of the language of
the Indians of the Falls of the Saskatchewan. In
this their native name was written <i>Ahnenin</i>. Mr.
Hale, however, calls them <i>Atsina</i>. Which is correct
is difficult to say.</p>

<p><i>Gros ventres</i> is another of their designations;
<i>Minetari of the Prairie</i> another. This last is
inconvenient, as well as incorrect, since the true
<i>Minetari</i> are a Sioux tribe, different in language,
manners, and descent.</p>

<p><i>Arrapaho</i> is a third synonym; and this is important,
since there are other <i>Arrapahoes</i> as far
south as the Platte and Arkansas Rivers.</p>

<p>The identity of name is <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> evidence of
two tribes so distant as those of Arkansas and the
Saskatchewan being either offsets from one another,
or else from some common stock; but it is not
more. Nothing can be less conclusive. This has
just been shown to be in the case of the term
<i>Minetari</i>.</p>

<p>The Ahnenin, or Atsina language is peculiar;
though the confederacy to which the Indians who
speak it belong, is the Blackfoot.</p>

<p>Of the southern Arrapaho we have no vocabulary;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
neither do we know whether the name
be native or not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A tract still stands over for notice. As we
have no exact northern limits for the Nehanni,
no exact western ones for the Dahodinni, and no
exact southern ones for the Loucheux, the parts
due east of the Russian boundary are undescribed.</p>

<p>I can only <i>contribute</i> to the ethnology here.</p>

<p><i>The Ugalentses.</i>&mdash;Round Mount St. Elias we
have a population of <i>Ugalentses</i> or Ugalyakhmutsi.
Though said to consist of less than forty families,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
as their manners are migratory, it is highly probable
that some of them are British.</p>

<p><i>The Tshugatsi</i>.&mdash;In contact with the Ugalents,
who are transitional between the true Eskimo and
the true Kol&uacute;ch, the Tshugatsi are unequivocally
Eskimo. The parts about Prince William's
Sound are their locality.</p>

<p><i>The Haidah.</i>&mdash;Queen Charlotte's, and the
southern extremity of the Prince of Wales' Archipelago,
are the parts to which the Indians speaking
the Haidah language have been referred. In case,
however, any members of their family extend into
the British territory, they are mentioned here.</p>

<p>Three Haidah tribes are more particularly
named&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Skittegat</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Cumshahas</i>&mdash;a name remarkably like
that of the <i>Chimsheyan</i>, hereafter to be noticed.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Kygani</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Tungaas.</i>&mdash;This is the name of the language
of the most Northern Indians, with which
the Hudson's Bay Company comes in contact. It
is Kol&uacute;ch; and more Russian than British.</p>

<p>The chief authority is Dr. Scouler. The whole
of his valuable remarks upon the North-western
Indians, is a commentary upon the assertion
already made as to the extent which we have
formed our ideas of the Aboriginal American
upon the Algonkins and Iroquois exclusively;
and his facts are a correction to our inferences.
In what way do the moral and intellectual characters
of the Western Indians differ from those
of the Eastern? I shall give the answer in
Dr. Scouler's only terms. They are less inflexible
in character. Their range of ideas is greater.
They are imitative and docile. They are comparatively
humane.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> No scalping. No excessive
torture of prisoners. No probationary inflictions.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;whether negative or positive&mdash;there is not
one of those characteristics wherein the Western
American differs from the Eastern, in which he
does not, at the same time, approach the Eskimo.
In the absence of the scalping-knife, the tomahawk,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the council fire, the wampum-belt, the
hero chief, and the metaphorical orator, the
Eskimo differs from the Ojibway, the Huron,
and the Mohawk. True. But the Haidah and
the Chimsheyan do the same.</p>

<p>The religion of the Algonkin and Iroquois is
Shamanistic; like the Negro of Africa they attribute
to some material object mysterious powers.
As far as the term has been defined, this is Feticism.
But, then, like the Finn, and the Samoeid
of Siberia, they either seek for themselves or
reverence in others, the excitement of fasting,
charms, and dreams. As far as the term has
been defined this is Shamanism. Now lest our
notions as to the religion of the Indians be rendered
unduly favourable through the ideas of
pure theism, called up by the missionary term
<i>Great Spirit</i>, we must simply remember, in the
first place, that the term is <i>ours</i>, not <i>theirs</i>; and
that those who, by looking to facts rather than
words, have criticised it, have arrived at the conclusion
that the creed of the Indians of the St.
Lawrence and Mississippi is neither better nor
worse than the creed of the Indians of the Columbia.
Both are alike, Shamanistic. And so
is the Eskimo.</p>

<p>The names in detail of the Indians of British
Oregon, over and above those of the Athabaskan
family already enumerated, are as follows; Dr.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Scouler still being the authority, and, along with
him, Mr. Tolmie and Mr. Hale.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Chimsheyan</i>, or <i>Chimmesyan</i>, on the sea-coast
and islands about 55&deg; North lat. Their
tribes are the <i>Naaskok</i>, the <i>Chimsheyan Proper</i>,
the <i>Kitshatlah</i>, and the <i>Kethumish</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Billichula</i>, on the mouth of the Salmon
River.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Hailtsa</i>, on the sea-coast, from Hawkesbury
Island to Broughton's Archipelago, and
(perhaps) the northern part of Quadra's and Vancouver's
Island. Their tribes are the <i>Hyshalla</i>,
the <i>Hyhysh</i>, the <i>Esleytuk</i>, the <i>Weekenoch</i>, the
<i>Nalatsenoch</i>, the <i>Quagheuil</i>, the <i>Ttatla-shequilla</i>,
and the <i>Lequeeltoch</i>. The numerals from Fitz-Hugh
Sound will be noticed in the sequel.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Nutka Sound Indians</i> occupy the greater
part of Quadra's and Vancouver's Island, speak the
<i>Wakash</i> language, and fall into the following
tribes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>The Naspatl.</i></p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>The Nutkans Proper.</i></p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>The Tlaoquatsh.</i></p>

<p><i>d.</i> <i>The Nittenat.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>The Shushwah</i>, or <i>Atna</i>, are bounded on the
north by the Takulli, belong to the interior rather
than the coast, are members of a large family,
called the <i>Tsihaili-Selish</i>, extending far into the
United States. According to Mr. Hale, they present<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the remarkable phenomenon of an aboriginal
stock having increased from about four hundred
to twelve hundred, instead of diminishing.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Kitunaha</i>, <i>Cutanies</i>, or <i>Flat-bows</i>, hardy,
brave and shrewd hunters on the Kitunaha, or
Flat-bow River, and conterminous with the Blackfoots,
are the Oregon Indians whose habits most
closely approach those of the Indians to the east
of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To some of these I now return, since three points
of Algonkin ethnology require special notice.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>The Nascopi</i> or <i>Skoffi</i>.&mdash;This is a frontier
tribe. Much as we connect the ideas of cold and
cheerless sterility with the inclement climate and
naked moorlands of Labrador, and much as we
connect the Eskimo as a population with a similarly
inhospitable country, it is only the coast of
that vast region which is thus tenanted. On
Hudson's Straits there are Eskimo; on the Straits
of Belleisle there are Eskimo; along the intervening
coast there are Eskimo, and as far south
as Anticosti there are Eskimo, but in the interior
there are no Eskimo. Instead of them we
find the Skoffi, and the Sheshatap&uacute;sh&mdash;subsections
(as stated before) of the same section of the
great Algonkin stock. In them we have a measure
of the effect of external conditions upon
different members of the same class. Between<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the Skoffi of Mosquito Bay and the Pamticos
of Cape Hatteras we have more than 25&deg; of
latitude combined with a difference of other physical
conditions which more than equals the difference
between north and south. Yet the contrast
between the Algonkin and other inhabitants
of Labrador is as evident (though not, perhaps, so
great) as that between the Greenlander and the
Virginian; so that just as the Norwegian is distinguishable
from the Laplander so is the Skoffi
from Eskimo.</p>

<p>Dirtier and coarser than any other Algonkins,
the Nascopi hunts and fishes for his livelihood
exclusively; depending most upon the autumnal
migrations of the reindeer; and, next to that,
upon his net. This he sets under the ice, during
the earlier months of the winter. After December,
however, he would set them in vain; the fish
being, then, all in the deep water. Woman, generally
a drudge in North America, is pre-eminently
so with the Nascopis. All that the man does,
is the <i>killing</i> of the game. The woman brings it
home. The woman also drags the loaded sledges
from squatting to squatting, clears the ground,
and collects fuel; whilst the man sits idle and
smokes. Of such domestic slaves more than one
is allowed; so that as far as the Nascopi recognizes
marriage at all, he is a polygamist. In this
sense the contracting parties are respectively the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
parents of the couple&mdash;the bride and bridegroom
being the last parties consulted. When all has
been arranged, the youth proceeds to his father-in-law's
tent, remains there a year, and then
departs as an independent member of the community.
Cousins are addressed as brothers or
sisters; marriage between near relations is allowed;
and so is the marriage of more than one sister
successively.</p>

<p>The Paganism of the Nascopi is that of the
other Cree tribes; their Christianity still more
partial and still more nominal. Sometimes rolling
in abundance, sometimes starving, they are
attached to the Whites by but few artificial wants;
the few fur-bearing animals of their country being
highly prized, and, consequently, going a long
way as elements of barter. Their dress is almost
wholly of reindeer skin; their travelling gear a
leathern bag with down in it, and a kettle. In
this bag the Nascopi thrusts his legs, draws his
knees up to his chin, and defies both wind and
snow.</p>

<p>This account has been condensed from M'Lean's
"Five and Twenty Years' Service in the Hudson's
Bay Territory." I subjoin the remainder
in his own words: "The horrid practice still
obtains among the Nascopis of destroying their
parents and relatives, when old age incapacitates
them for further exertion. I must, however, do<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
them the justice to say, that the parent himself
expresses a wish to depart, otherwise the unnatural
deed would probably never be committed,
for they, in general, treat their old people with
much care and tenderness. The son, or nearest
relative, performs the office of executioner&mdash;the
self-devoted victim being disposed of by strangulation."</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>The Aborigines of Newfoundland.</i>&mdash;Sebastian
Cabot brought three Newfoundlanders to England.
They were clothed in beasts' skin, and ate
raw flesh. This last is an accredited characteristic
of the Eskimo; and, thus far, the evidence is in
favour of the savages in question belonging to
that stock. Yet it is more than neutralized by
what follows; since Purchas states that two
years after he saw two of them, dressed like
Englishmen, "which, at that time, I could not
discover from Englishmen, till I learned what
they were."</p>

<p>Now as the Bethuck&mdash;the aborigines in question&mdash;have
either been cruelly exterminated, or exist
in such small numbers as not to have been seen
for many years, it has been a matter of doubt
whether they were Eskimo or Micmacs, the
present occupants of the island. Reasons against
either of these views are supplied by a hitherto
unpublished Bethuck vocabulary, with which I
have been kindly furnished by my friend Dr. King,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the Ethnological Society. This makes them a
<i>separate section</i> of the Algonkins. Such I believe
them to have been, and have placed them accordingly.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>The Fitz-Hugh Sound Numerals.</i>&mdash;These are
nearly the same as the Hailtsa. On the other
hand, they agree with the Blackfoot in ending in
-<i>scum</i>.</p>

<p>Now if the resemblance go farther, so as really
to connect the Blackfoot with the Hailtsa, it brings
the Algonkin class of languages across the whole
breadth of the continent, and as far as the shores
of the Pacific.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Moskito Indians are no subjects of England,
any more than the Tahitians are of France, or the
Sandwich Islanders of America, France, and England
conjointly. The Moskito coast is a Protectorate:
and the Moskito Indians are the subjects
of a native king.</p>

<p>The present reigning monarch was educated
under English auspices at Jamaica, and, upon
attaining his majority, crowned at Grey Town.
I believe that his name is that of the grandfather
of our late gracious majesty. King George, then,
king of the Moskitos, has a territory extending
from the neighbourhood of Truxillo to the lower
part of the River San Juan; a territory whereof,
inconveniently for Great Britain, the United<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
States, and the commerce of the world at large,
the limits and definition are far from being universally
recognized. Nicaragua has claims, and
the Isthmus canal suffers accordingly.</p>

<p>The king of the Moskito coast, and the emperor
of the Brazil, are the only resident sovereigns of
the New World.</p>

<p>The subjects of the former are, really, the
aborigines of the whole line of coast between
Nicaragua and Honduras&mdash;there being no Indians
remaining in the former republic, and but few in
the latter. Of these, too&mdash;the Nicaraguans&mdash;we
have no definite ethnological information. Mr.
Squier speaks of them as occupants of the islands
of the lakes of the interior. Colonel Galindo also
mentions them; but I infer, from his account,
that their original language is lost, and that
Spanish is their present tongue; just as it is said to
be that of the aborigines of St. Salvador and Costa
Rica. This makes it difficult to fix them. And
the difficulty is increased when we resort to history,
tradition, and arch&aelig;ology. History makes
them Mexicans&mdash;Asteks from the kingdom of
Montezuma, and colonists of the Peninsula, just
as the Ph&#339;nicians were of Carthage. Arch&aelig;ology
goes the same way. A detailed description of
Mr. Squier's discoveries, is an accession to ethnology
which is anxiously expected. At any rate,
stone ruins and carved decorations have been<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
found; so that what Mr. Stephenson has written
about Yucatan and Guatemala, may be repeated in
the case of Nicaragua. Be it so. The difficulty
will be but increased; since whatever facts makes
Nicaragua Mexican, isolates the Moskitos. They
are now in contact with Spaniards and Englishmen&mdash;populations
whose civilization differs from
their own; and populations who are evidently
intrusive and of recent origin. Precisely the same
would be the case, if the Nicaraguans were made
Mexican. The civilization would be of another
sort; the population which introduced it would
be equally intrusive; and the only difference
would be a difference of stage and degree&mdash;a little
earlier in the way of time, and a little less contrast
in the way of skill and industry.</p>

<p>But the evidence in favour of the Mexican
origin of the Nicaraguans, is doubtful; and so is
the fact of their having wholly lost their native
tongue; and until one of these two opinions be
proved, it will be well to suspend our judgment as
to the isolation of the Moskitos. If, indeed, either
of them be true, their ethnological position will be
a difficult question. With nothing in Honduras
to compare them with&mdash;with nothing tangible, or
with an apparently incompatible affinity in Nicaragua&mdash;with
only very general miscellaneous affinities
in Guatemala&mdash;their ethnological affinities
are as peculiar as their political constitution.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Nevertheless, isolated as their language is, it has
undoubted <i>general affinities with those of America
at large</i>; and this is all that it is safe to say at
present. But it is safe to say <i>this</i>. We have
plenty of data for their tongue, in a grammar of
Mr. Henderson's, published at New York, 1846.</p>

<p>The chief fact in the history of the Moskitos, is
that they were never subject to the Spaniards.
Each continent affords a specimen of this isolated
freedom&mdash;the independence of some exceptional
and impracticable tribes, as compared
with the universal empire of some encroaching
European power. The Circassians in Caucasus,
the Tshuktshi Koriaks in North-eastern Asia,
and the Kaffres in Africa, show this. Their
relations with the buccaneers were, probably, of
an amicable description. So they were with
the Negroes&mdash;maroon and imported. And this,
perhaps, has determined their <i>differenti&aelig;</i>. They
are intertropical American aborigines, who have
become partially European, without becoming
Spanish.</p>

<p>Their physical conformation is that of the
South rather than the North American; and,
here it must be remembered, that we are passing
from one moiety of the new hemisphere to the
other. With a skin which is olive-coloured rather
than red, they have small limbs and undersized
frames; whilst their habits are, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
those of the intertropical African. This means,
that the exuberance of soil, and the heat of the
climate, makes them agriculturists rather than
shepherds, and idlers rather than agriculturists;
since the least possible amount of exertion gives
them roots and fruits; whilst it is only those wants
which are compatible with indolence that they
care to satisfy. They presume rather than improve
upon the warmth of their suns, and the
fertility of the soil. When they get liquor, they
get drunk; when they work hardest, they cut
mahogany. Canoes and harpoons represent the
native industry. <i>Wulasha</i> is the name of their
Evil Spirit, and <i>Liwaia</i> that of a water-god.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that there is much intermixture
amongst them. At the same time, the <i>data</i>
for ascertaining the amount are wanting. Their
greatest intercourse has, probably, been with the
Negro; their next greatest with the Englishman.
Of the population of the interior, we know next
to nothing. Here their neighbours are Spaniards.</p>

<p>They are frontagers to the river San Juan.
This gives them their value in politics.</p>

<p>They are the only well-known extant Indians
between Guatemala and Veragua. This gives
them their value in ethnology.</p>

<p>The populations to which they were most immediately
allied, have disappeared from history.
This isolates them; so that there is no class to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which they can be subordinated. At the same
time, they are quite as like the nearest known
tribes as the <i>American</i> ethnologist is prepared to
expect.</p>

<p>What they were in their truly natural state,
when, unmodified by either Englishman or Spaniard,
Black or Indian, they represented the indigenous
civilization (such as it was) of their coast,
is uncertain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That the difference between the North and
South American aborigines has been over-rated,
is beyond doubt. The tendency, however, to do
so, decreases. An observer like Sir R. Schomburgk,
who is at once minute in taking notice,
and quick at finding parallels, adds his suffrage to
that of Cicca de Leon and others, who enlarge
upon the extent to which the Indians of the New
World in general look "like children of one
family." On the other hand, however, there are
writers like D'Orbigny. These expatiate upon the
difference between members of the same class, so
as to separate, not only Caribs from Algonkins, or
Peruvians from Athabaskans, but Peruvians from
Caribs, and Patagonians from Brazilians.</p>

<p>Now it is no paradox to assert that these two
views, instead of contradicting, support each
other. A writer exhibits clear and undeniable
differences between two American tribes in geographical<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
juxtaposition to one another. But
does this prove a difference of origin, stock, or
race? Not necessarily. Such differences may
be, and often are, partial. More than this&mdash;they
may be more than neutralized by undeniable
marks of affinity. In such a case, all that they
prove is the extent to which really allied populations
may be contrasted in respect to certain
particular characters.</p>

<p>Stature is the chief point in which the North
American has the advantage of the Southern, <i>e.g.</i>,
the Algonkin over the Carib. Such is Sir R.
Schomburgk's remark; and such is the general
rule. Yet a vast number of the Indians of the
Oregon, are shorter than the South American
Patagonian and Pampa tribes. The head is large
as compared with the trunk, and the trunk with
the limbs; the hands small; the foot large; the skin
soft, though with larger pores than in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Indians of British Guiana.</i>&mdash;These are distributed
amongst four divisions, of very unequal
magnitude and importance.&mdash;1. The Carib.
2. The Warow. 3. The Wapisiana. 4. The
Taruma.</p>

<p>The number of vocabularies collected by Sir R.
Schomburgk was eighteen.</p>

<p>1. The great <i>Carib</i> group falls into three
divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The Caribs Proper.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> The Tamanaks.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The Arawaks.</p>

<p>Of these, it is only members of the first and
last that occupy British Guiana.</p>

<p><i>The Arawaks.</i>&mdash;The Arawaks are our nearest
neighbours, and, consequently, the most Europeanized.
Sir R. Schomburgk says, that they
and the Warows amount to about three thousand,
and from Bernau we infer, that this number is
nearly equally divided between the two; since he
reckons the Arawaks at about fifteen hundred.
Each family has its distinctive tattoo, and these
families are twenty-seven in number.</p>

<p>The children may marry into their father's
family, but not into that of their mother. Now
as the caste is derived from their mother, this is
an analogue of the North American <i>totem</i>. Polygamy
is chiefly the privilege of the chiefs. The
<i>Pe-i-man</i> is the Arawak <i>Shaman</i>. He it is who
names the children&mdash;<i>for a consideration</i>. Failing
this, the progeny goes nameless; and to go nameless
is to be obnoxious to all sorts of misfortunes.</p>

<p>Imposture is hereditary; and as soon as the son
of a conjuror enters his twentieth year, his right
ear is pierced, he is required to wear a ring, and
he is trusted with the secrets of the craft.</p>

<p>In imitating what they see, and remembering
what they hear, the Arawak has, at least, an
average capacity. Neither is he destitute of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
ingenuity. Notation he has none; and the numeration
is of the rudest kind.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr class="tr4"><td>Aba-da-kabo</td><td>=</td><td>once my hand</td><td>=</td><td><i>five</i>.</td></tr>
<tr class="tr4"><td>Biama-da-kabo</td><td>=</td><td>twice my hand</td><td>=</td><td><i>ten</i>.</td></tr>
<tr class="tr4"><td>Aba-olake</td><td>=</td><td>one man</td><td>=</td><td><i>twenty</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Perfect nudity is rare amongst the women; and
some neatness in the dressing of their hair is perceptible.
It is tied up on the crown of the
head.</p>

<p>The nearer the coast the darker the skin; the
lightest coloured families being as fair as Spaniards.
This is on the evidence of Bernau, who
adds, that, as children grow in knowledge and
receive instruction, the forehead rises, and the
physiognomy improves.</p>

<p>The other Guiana Indians, so far as they are
Carib at all, are Caribs Proper, rather than Arawaks.
Of these, the chief are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Accaways</i>,&mdash;occupants of the rivers Mazaruni
and Putara, with about six hundred fighting
men. They are jealous, quarrelsome, and cruel;
firm friends and bitter enemies. When resisted,
they kill; when unopposed, enslave.</p>

<p>The law of revenge predominates in this tribe;
for&mdash;like certain Australians&mdash;they attribute all
deaths to contrivances of an enemy. Workers in
poison themselves, they suspect it with others.</p>

<p>Their skin is redder than the Arawaks', but<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
then their nudity is more complete; inasmuch as,
instead of clothing, they paint themselves; arnotto
being their red, lana their blue pigment. They
pierce the <i>septum</i> of the nose, and wear wood in
the holes, like the Eskimo, Loucheux, and others.
They paint the face in streaks, and the body
variously&mdash;sometimes blue on one side, and red
on the other. They rub their bodies with carapa
oil, to keep off insects; and <i>one</i> of the ingredients
of their numerous poisons, is a kind of black ant
called <i>muneery</i>.</p>

<p>Their forehead is depressed.</p>

<p>They give nicknames to each other and to
strangers, irrespective of rank; and the better
their authorities take it the greater their influence.</p>

<p>It is the belief of the Accaways that the spirit
of the deceased hovers over the dwelling in which
death took place, and that it will not tolerate
disturbance. Hence they bury the corpse <i>in</i> the
hammock, and <i>under</i> the hut in which it became
one. This they burn and desert.</p>

<p><i>The Carab&iacute;si.</i>&mdash;Twenty years ago the Carab&iacute;si
(<i>Carabeese</i>, <i>Carabisce</i>) mustered one thousand
fighting men. It would now be difficult to raise
one hundred. But the diminution of their
numbers and importance began earlier still.
Beyond the proper Carab&iacute;si area, there are numerous
Carab&iacute;si names of rivers, islands, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
other geographical objects. Hence, their area
has decreased.</p>

<p>Omnivorous enough to devour greedily tigers,
dogs, rats, frogs, insects, and other sorts of food,
unpopular elsewhere, they are distinguished by
their ornaments as well. The under-lip is the
part which they perforate, and wherein they wear
their usual pins; besides which they fasten a
large lump of arnotto to the hair of the front of
the head.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases the hammock in which the
death took place, serves as a coffin, the body
is buried, and a funeral procession made once or
twice round the grave; but the bodies of persons
of importance are watched and washed by the
nearest female relations, and when nothing but
the skeleton remains, the bones are cleaned,
painted, packed in a basket and preserved. When,
however, there is a change of habitation they are
<i>burned</i>; after which the ashes are collected, and
kept.</p>

<p>Here we have interment and cremation in one
and the same tribe; a circumstance which should
guard us against exaggerating their value as
characteristic and distinguishing customs.</p>

<p>Again. The <i>Macusi</i> is closely akin to the Carab&iacute;si;
yet the Macusi buries his dead in a sitting
posture without coffins, and with but few ceremonies.
Now the sitting posture is common to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the Peruvians, the Oregon Indians, and numerous
tribes of Brazil; indeed, Morton considers it to
be one of the most remarkable characteristics of
the Red Man of America in general.</p>

<p>The Arawak custom is peculiar. When a man
of note dies his relations plant a field of cassava;
just as the Nicobar Islanders plant a cocoa-nut
tree. Then they lament loudly. But when twelve
moons are over, and the cassava is ripe, they
re-assemble, feast, dance, and lash each other
cruelly, and severely with whips. The whips are
then <i>hung up</i> on the spot where the person died.
Six moons later a second meeting takes place&mdash;and,
this time, the whips are <i>buried</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Waika</i> are a small tribe of the <i>Accaways</i>;
the <i>Zapara</i> of the <i>Macusis</i>. Besides these, the
following Guiana Indians are Carib.</p>

<p>The <i>Arecuna</i>; of which the <i>Soerikong</i> are a
section.</p>

<p>The <i>Waiyamara</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Guinau</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Maiongkong</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Woyawai</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Mawakwa</i>, or Frog Indians&mdash;a tribe that
flattens the head.</p>

<p>The <i>Piano-ghotto</i>; of which the <i>Zaramata</i> and
<i>Drio</i> are sections.</p>

<p>The <i>Tiveri-ghotto</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Warow</i>, <i>Waraw</i>, <i>Warau</i>, or <i>Guarauno</i>.&mdash;These<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
are the Indians of the Delta of the Orinoco,
and the parts between that river and the Pomaroon.
Their language is peculiar, but by no
means without miscellaneous affinities. They are
the fluviatile boatmen of South America. Their
habit of taking up their residence in trees when
the ground is flooded, has given both early and
late writers an opportunity of enlarging upon
their semi-arboreal habits.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Wapisianas</i> fall into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Wapisianas</i> Proper&mdash;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Atorai</i>, of which the <i>Taurai</i>, or <i>Dauri</i>
(the same word under another form), and the extinct,
or nearly extinct, <i>Amaripas</i> are divisions.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Parauana</i>.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Tarumas</i>, on the Upper Essequibo,
have their probable affinities with the uninvestigated
tribes of Central South America.</p>

<p>The Indians of Trinidad are Carib. So are
those of St. Vincents. In no other West Indian
islands are there any aborigines extant.</p>
